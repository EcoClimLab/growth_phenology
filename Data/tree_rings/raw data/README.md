# Raw tree-ring data

This file contains raw tree-ring data for the chronologies analyzed in this study.

Format: Files are in [Tuscon format](http://www.cybis.se/wiki/index.php/Tucson_format) (.rwl files).

File names: Files are named as the site name appended with the species name (usually a 4-letter species code: first 2 letters of genus, first 2 letters of species) and sometimes an additional designation distinguishing among file versions.

## SCBI

Folders and files in this folder were copied over from the GitHub repository for the analysis of Helcoski et al. 2018 (*New Phytologist*): [SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores). 

Master files of the SCBI raw tree-ring data (.rwl files found in subfolders) are located in the [SCBI-ForestGEO-Data GitHub repository](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_cores/chronologies).

## Harvard Forest

Raw data from Harvard Forest for *Quercus rubra*, *Acer rubrum*, and *Betula alleghaniensis* were copied to this repository from the [EDI data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-hfr&identifier=407) (DOI: 10.6073/pasta/da1c9d5591e33a7871b9b43f5c762c97). 

Raw data for Harvard Forest *Fraxinus americana* are archived here (HarvardForest_FRAM; file from Grant Harley).

## Other sites

Files for other sites were provided (most proximally) by co-author Justin Maxwell.
