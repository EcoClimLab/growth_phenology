# Data

Most of the data analyzed here are published in additional locations that should be considered the master archives. Raw data are copied here for convenience and to retain exact copies of the data analyzed here. 

## Dendrometer bands
Master versions of the dendrometer band data are available for SCBI via GitHub in the *Dendrobands* repository of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute ForestGEO plot (https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands), which is archived in Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.5551143), and for Harvard Forest via the Harvard Forest Data Archive (https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF149). 

## Weather data
Weather data for SCBI were obtained from the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal v1.0 (https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/Met_Stations/SCBI), which is archived in Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3958215), and the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) weather station located in Front Royal, Virginia (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00443229/detail).
Weather data for Harvard Forest are available through the Harvard Forest Data Archive (https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF001 AND https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF000).
Climate data were obtained from CRU v.4.04 via the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal v1.0 (https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/CRU), which is archived in Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3958215).
The Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index was obtained from the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal v1.0 (https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/SPEI), which is archived in Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3958215).

## Leaf phenology
Canopy foliage phenology data were extracted from the MCD12Q2 V6 Land Cover Dynamics product (a.k.a. MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product) via Google Earth Engine (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MCD12Q2#description). 

## Tree rings
In addition to being archived in this project's repository, many tree-ring data sets are archived in the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB;https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring), the DendroEcological Network (DEN; https://www.uvm.edu/femc/dendro/), and/or the Harvard Forest Data Archive (https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/harvard-forest-data-archive), as detailed in the [chronology table](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/doc/manuscript/tables_figures/chronology_table.csv) (SI Table 1). 
Original tree cores are archived at the institutions of various members of the author team (Harvard Forest, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Indiana University, and University of Idaho) and will be made available upon reasonable request.
