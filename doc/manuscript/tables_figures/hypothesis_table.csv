1. Warmer early springs result in earlier stem growth and longer growing seasons,,,,
- DOY25 is negatively correlated with early spring T.,yes,yes,yes,yes
- DOY50 is negatively correlated with early spring T.,yes,yes,yes,yes
- DOY75 is negatively correlated with early spring T.,-,yes,yes,yes
- DOY of max growth rate is negatively correlated with early spring T,,,,
- Peak growing season length (DOY75-DOY25) is positively correlated with early spring temperatures.,,,,
2. Maximum growth rates are independent of early spring temperatures.,,,,
- Max growth rate is independent of early spring temperatures.,,,,
3. Annual stem growth responds positively to warmer spring temperatures.,,,,
- Annual growth is positively correlated with early spring temperatures.,yes,yes,-,-
