As the climate changes, warmer spring temperatures are causing earlier leaf-out[@jeong_phenology_2011;@keenan_net_2014; @buermann_widespread_2018] and commencement of net carbon dioxide (CO~2~) sequestration[@keenan_net_2014] in temperate deciduous forests, resulting in a tendency towards increased growing season length[@menzel_growing_1999;@menzel_european_2006;@ibanez_forecasting_2010;@jeong_phenology_2011] and annual CO~2~ sequestration[@keeling_increased_1996;@dragoni_evidence_2011;@keenan_net_2014; @crabbe_extreme_2016; @zhou_explaining_2016; @fu_maximum_2019].
However, less is known about how spring temperatures affect  tree stem growth, which sequesters carbon in wood that has a long residence time in the ecosystem [@xue_global_2017;@russell_residence_2014] or as wood products[@profft_forest_2009].
Here, we show that in two forests, warmer spring temperatures consistently shifted the woody growth of deciduous trees earlier but had mixed, weak effects on peak growing season length, maximum daily growth rates, and annual growth.
The latter finding was confirmed on the centennial scale by `r n_chronologies` tree-ring chronologies from `r n_cores_sites` forests across eastern North America, where annual growth was far more sensitive to temperatures during the peak growing season than in the spring.
These findings imply that any extra CO~2~ sequestered in years with warmer springs[@keeling_increased_1996;@dragoni_evidence_2011;@crabbe_extreme_2016] is not allocated to long-lived woody biomass, where it could have a substantial and lasting impact on the forest C balance. 
Thus, warming spring temperatures are unlikely to increase the woody productivity or strengthen the carbon sink of temperate deciduous forests.

*removed from abstract; to integrate elsewhere:*

tree stem growth consumes only a modest portion of the carbon fixed annually[@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2021]

These findings align with those of previous studies that suggest annual CO~2~ sequestration is more strongly linked to conditions in the peak growing season than to growing season length[@fu_maximum_2019; @zhang_drought_2021] and with observations that warm springs result in earlier leaf senescence of deciduous trees because CO~2~ sequestration is sink limited [@zohner_ongoing_2019; @zani_increased_2020].
They contrast, however, with the expectation *in most models[@zani_increased_2020]* that an earlier start to growing season would significantly increase the rate of biomass accumulation and thereby enhance the CO~2~ sink of temperate deciduous forests.


\newpage

Warming temperatures in recent decades have resulted in widespread phenological changes indicative of earlier arrival of spring[@parmesan_globally_2003, @ibanez_forecasting_2010,@jeong_phenology_2011,@friedl_tale_2014] and sometimes later autumn senesence[@ibanez_forecasting_2010,@jeong_phenology_2011; @keenan_net_2014].
In temperate deciduous forests, spring leaf-out has been occurring earlier[@ibanez_forecasting_2010, @jeong_phenology_2011], as has the beginning of the annual period of net CO~2~ sequestration [@piao_net_2008; @barichivich_large-scale_2013; @keenan_net_2014].
Warmer spring temperatures and earlier leaf-out are also linked to earlier leaf senescence[@zohner_ongoing_2019;@keenan_timing_2015; @fu_variation_2014], apparently because of sink-limitation to CO~2~ sequestration[@zani_increased_2020; @lempereur_growth_2015].
Additionally, Warmer summer and autumn temperatures coupled with drought led to a delay of leaf senescence[@zohner_ongoing_2019;@xie_predicting_2018; @crabbe_extreme_2016; @dragoni_evidence_2011; @jeong_phenology_2011; @ibanez_forecasting_2010; @vitasse_responses_2009] while heavy rainfall and heat stress led to earlier senescence[@xie_predicting_2018]. As a result, warming may advance or delay autumn senescence depending on timing of warming and water availability, with delays more common across eastern North America [@buermann_widespread_2018]. 

Spring warming generally results in an increased growing season length, measured as the period over which trees have photosynthetically active leaves[@jeong_phenology_2011;;@ibanez_forecasting_2010;;@menzel_european_2006;@menzel_growing_1999] and the ecosystem is a net CO~2~ sink (Are flux sources used above ok to put here?) [@piao_net_2008; @barichivich_large-scale_2013; @keenan_net_2014].
The expectation, is that as growing season length increases, net annual carbon sequestered will increase as well (*i,e*, net ecosystem exchange, $NEE$)[@churkina_spatial_2005; @keenan_net_2014; @zhou_explaining_2016; @fu_maximum_2019], and [this expectation is represented in models](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/issues/56) [@buermann_widespread_2018; @zani_increased_2020].

However, recent evidence that positive effects of warm springs are compensated by negative effects of accumulation of seasonal water deficits [@buermann_widespread_2018] and that leaf senescence and stem growth cessation is induced when water deficits reach a certain point[@lempereur_growth_2015] or sink factors become limiting [@zani_increased_2020; @zohner_how_2021] suggests that warmer spring temperatures and earlier leaf-out may not have a positive effect on C sequestration in trees.

Temperate deciduous forests, including those in eastern North America, have historically been net carbon sinks. 

Resources or temperature effects on the sink (the tree) can limit growth before the source (CO2) is limiting. The implication is that the benefits of CO2 fertilization will eventually reach a maximum as other resources necessary for plant growthare depleted. Currently, our understanding of when and where these limits will be reached is incomplete, so forest models tend to assume the increase in photosynthesis as atmospheric CO2 levels increase is unlimited.(Maybe not true, i'm not 100% familiar with the modeling still.) 

As Earth's atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations and temperatures increase, the responses and feedbacks of forests will play an important yet uncertain role in influencing atmospheric CO~2~ and climate change[@arora_carbon_2020; @friedlingstein_global_2020]. 
Understanding how trees are responding to warming temperatures and rising CO2 levels, and how growth may become limited because of interactions between the two is essential to improve our predictions. Under controlled conditions, spring warming increases biomass accumulation in trees, with a larger proportion of root growth compared to shoot growth[@zohner_how_2021]. To our knowledge, the link between stem phenology and growth has never been studied in-situ.

We know very little about how the longest-lived component of fixed carbon in trees, the woody growth, is responding to warming spring temperatures. 
In fact, we know little about the stem-growth phenology of temperate deciduous species, with multi-year records of growth phenology having been published for only a few site [@doranngeville_radial_inreview; @martin_hydrometeorology_2017]. *(We need to make sure we're not missing anything. See European study cited in A-T et al in review)* 
Tree-ring records, which can be used to examine correlations of annual growth to monthly temperatures but not to understand growth phenology, reveal that growth of temperate deciduous trees tends to be most sensitive to summer temperatures (REFS), with some hints that warmer springs may have a modest positive effect on growth (e.g., Refs.[@helcoski_growing_2019;@] [MORE]).
Thus, tree-ring records do not necessarily support the suggestion that warming spring temperatures would increase annual CO~2~ sequestration. 
Characterizing phenological responses of stem growth to warming spring temperatures is critical to bridging this conceptual disconnect and understanding how forest biomass growth is likely to change as the climate warms.(Loic suggests adding numbers to illustrate the importatnce of stem growth as a carbon sink.)

Here, we characterize how early spring temperatures affect stem growth phenology, growth rates, and annual growth of temperate deciduous trees in two forests and annual growth across forests spanning eastern North America.

## Dendrometer band analysis {-#Dendrometer} 

First, using dendrometer band measurements taken throughout the growing season at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI; Virginia; n = **146** trees from 2011-2020) and Harvard Forest (Massachusetts; n = **755** trees from 1998-2003), we fit a growth model[@mcmahon_general_2015] to determine the days of year where 25, 50, and 75% annual growth was achieved ($DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, $DOY_{75}$), peak growing season length ($L_{pgs}= DOY_{75}$-$DOY_{25}$), maximum growth rates ($g_{max}$) and the DOY on which they occurred ($DOY_{g_{max}}$), and total annual growth ($\Delta DBH$; Fig. `r schematic_summary`). 
This analysis was performed separately for ring- and diffuse-porous species, which differ in growth phenology[@doranngeville_radial_inreview], and set in the context of leaf phenology at these sites.

![`r schematic_summary_caption`](tables_figures/schematic_summary_with_table.png){ width=70% }



Both leaf phenology and stem growth milestones occurred earlier at SCBI than at Harvard Forest, with stem growth milestones achieved on average 6-10 days earlier at SCBI (Fig. `r DOY_timing`, `r  EDT_mean_growth_parameters`).
Consistent with the results of Ref[@doranngeville_radial_inreview], ring-porous species began growing earlier, reaching the $DOY_{25}$ benchmark earlier (by `r 154-123` days at SCBI and `r 164-132` at Harvard Forest), and their growth was spread out over a longer growing season (average $L_{PGS}$ 21 and 19 days longer at SCBI and Harvard Forest, respectively; Fig. `r DOY_timing`, `r  EDF_growth_curves_all`, `r  EDT_mean_growth_parameters`). 
Growing season length was similar across sites, with $L_{PGS}$ being, on average, only two days longer at SCBI for ring-porous species and less than one day longer for diffuse-porous species (`r  EDT_mean_growth_parameters`). 

![`r DOY_timing_caption`](tables_figures/DOYtiming_allyears.png){ width=25% }

 
Both leaf phenology and stem growth were sensitive to spring temperatures (Figs. `r DOY_timing`, `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`-`r EDF_pheno_Tmin_AprilMay`). 
While the results described below were qualitatively consistent considering both maximum and minimum temperatures ($T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$, respectively) across a range of spring time windows (Extended Data Figures 3-7), we focused our analyses on the strongest relationships: responses to $T_{max}$ over the consecutive weekly time window between Jan. 1 and $DOY_{25}$  for which the correlation between $T_{max}$ and $DOY_{25}$ was strongest (henceforth, critical temperature window; Fig. `r schematic_summary`). 
The strongest relationships, including but not limited to the critical temperature window (`r  EDT_mean_growth_parameters`), occurred for time windows closing $\le$ 5 weeks prior to $DOY_{25}$ (`r EDF_climwin`). 

For both ring- and diffuse- porous species at both sites, warmer $T_{max}$ in the critical temperature window resulted in earlier achievement of growth milestones (Figs. `r schematic_summary`, `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`).
Consistent with findings from previous studies[@parmesan_globally_2003, @ibanez_forecasting_2010,@friedl_tale_2014], at our focal sites the DOY of leaf greenup (measured at ecosystem level via remote sensing) advanced with increasing $T_{max}$ during the critical temperature window (p=0.001). 
Specifically, greenup DOY advanced 4.5 days/$^\circ$C at SCBI and 2.4 days/ $^\circ$C at Harvard Forest when comparing the years with the warmest and coldest mean $T_{max}$ during the critical temperature window, and mid-greenup also advanced, but to a lesser extent (Fig. `r DOY_timing`).
Similarly, at both sites, $DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, $DOY_{75}$, and $DOY_{g_{max}}$ all decreased with mean $T_{max}$ during the critical temperature window (Figs. `r schematic_summary`, `r DOY_timing`; see also Extended Data Figures `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`-`r EDF_pheno_Tmin_AprilMay`).
Specifically, at SCBI, RP growth advanced 1.9, 1.5, and 1.1 days/ $^\circ$C for $DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, and $DOY_{75}$, respectively, while DP growth advanced 3.5, 3.5, and 3.6 days/ $^\circ$C for $DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, and $DOY_{75}$, respectively.
At Harvard Forest, RP growth advanced 2.8, 5.0, and 7.2 days/ $^\circ$C for $DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, and $DOY_{75}$, respectively, while DP growth advanced 7.9, 7.3, and 6.6 days/ $^\circ$C for $DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, and $DOY_{75}$, respectively.

Whereas the length of time between leaf greenup and senescence (*i.e.,* the day when greenness dropped below 90% of its peak) increased in years with warmer temperatures during the critical temperature window compared to those with cooler temperatures (Fig. `r DOY_timing`), there was no consistent lengthening of $L_{PGS}$. 
Specifically, because $DOY_{75}$ -- and not only $DOY_{25}$ -- shifted earlier in years with warm springs, $L_{PGS}$ displayed mixed responses to spring temperatures (Fig. `r schematic_summary`, Extended Data Figures `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`-`r EDF_pheno_Tmin_AprilMay`).

In contrast to the pronounced effects of $T_{max}$ on the timing of growth, its effects on $g_{max}$ and $\Delta DBH$ were less consistent and generally quite subtle (Figs. `r schematic_summary`, `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`). 
Neither maximum seasonal growth rate, $g_{max}$, nor annual growth measured with dendrometer bands, $\Delta DBH$, was consistently linked to early spring temperatures (Fig. `r schematic_summary`, Extended Data Figures `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin` - `r EDF_pheno_Tmin_AprilMay`).
Specifically, $g_{max}$, which occurred very close to $DOY_{50}$ (on $DOY_{g.max}$; `r EDT_mean_growth_parameters`), displayed either no relationship to mean $T_{max}$ during the critical temperature window (SCBI), or extremely small changes in opposite directions for ring- and diffuse- porous species (Harvard Forest),
while $\Delta DBH$ displayed no relationship with mean $T_{max}$ during the critical temperature window (`r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`). 
Given the subtlety of these responses, a much longer record was needed to clarify what, if any, effect spring temperatures have on stem growth.

## Tree ring analysis {-#Tree} 

To understand how annual growth increments have responded to spring temperatures at the centennial scale, we analyzed tree-ring chronologies from our focal study sites  (`r EDT_species`) and across an additional `r n_cores_sites-2` locations (Fig. `r tree_rings`, `r EDF_map`).
For `r n_chronologies_SCBI` species at SCBI and `r n_chronologies_HF` species at Harvard Forest, ring width indices (RWI) rarely exhibited significant correlations to either $T_{max}$ or $T_{min}$ in the months corresponding to the critical temperature windows identified here (Fig. `r tree_rings`, `r EDF_tree_rings_TMIN`).
Although correlations were rarely significant, there was a consistent pattern in responses to $T_{max}$ across all species at both sites:
responses to $T_{max}$ were negative or neutral in all months from February to August, with the exception of one spring month at each site (April at SCBI, May at Harvard Forest) where growth displayed a positive or neutral response to $T_{max}$ (Fig. `r tree_rings`).
In these months, positive correlations to $T_{max}$ were statistically significant (at p=0.05) for one of nine ring-porous species at SCBI and one of two diffuse-porous species at each site.
Starting in May at SCBI and June at Harvard Forest, negative correlations of RWI to $T_{max}$ were predominant, being statistically significant in at least one growing season month for all `r n_chronologies_SCBI` species at SCBI and one of `r n_chronologies_HF` species at Harvard Forest. 
Patterns in $T_{min}$ were fairly similar to those of $T_{max}$, but weaker and more stochastic, with more (non-significant) correlations going in opposite directions (`r EDF_tree_rings_TMIN`). 

![`r tree_rings_caption`](tables_figures/tree_rings_tmax.png){ width=100% }


The patterns observed at our focal sites were mirrored across an additional `r n_chronologies-n_chronologies_SCBI-n_chronologies_HF` chronologies from `r n_cores_sites-2` sites (Fig. `r tree_rings`; `r EDF_map`)[@dorangeville_drought_2018].
In total, our analysis included `r_n_chronologies` species at sites distributed from Alabama (Lat = 34.35) to Michigan (Lat = 45.56) and spanning a 15 $^\circ$C range in April $T_{max}$.
Across all chronologies (focal sites included), RWI was significantly positively correlated with April $T_{max}$ for only 1% of records: 1 of 142 ring-porous and 2 of 66 diffuse-porous species-site combinations.
In contrast, RWI was frequently significantly negatively correlated with $T_{max}$ during peak growing season months (May-August), with significant correlations for 53% (May: 47/142, Jun: 108/142, Jul: 90/142, Aug: 57/142) and 46% (May: 11/66, Jun: 53/66, Jul: 37/66, Aug: 22/66) of species-site-month combinations for ring-porous and diffuse-porous species, respectively.
Again, $T_{min}$ generally exerted less influence over annual growth than $T_{max}$ (`r EDF_tree_rings_TMIN`), with few significant correlations between spring $T_{min}$ and RWI.

## Discussion {-#Discussion} 

Together, our results demonstrate that warmer spring temperatures in the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America advance the phenology of tree stem growth but have little effect on annual woody productivity (Figs. `r schematic_summary`- `r tree_rings`). 
The observed advance in the timing of stem growth milestones under warmer springs is consistent with similar phenological advances observed for leaf development (Fig. `r DOY_timing`)[@keenan_net_2014] and NEE [@keenan_net_2014].
*It would be interesting to compare the magnitude of these advances (days per degree C)*
However, inconsistent with leaf phenology and NEE, we observed that the length of the period of most active stem growth does not increase under warmer springs. 
This suggests that the growth benefit of warmer springs is compensated by negative effects later in the growing season, with two primary possible mechanisms.
First, stem growth, like leaf phenology[@zani_increased_2020], may be sink-limited, such that an advance in the start of growth ($DOY_25$) would lead to an earlier depletion of resources needed for growth resulting in an earlier end to the season of rapid growth ($DOY_{75}$).
Warm springs may also be associated with greater seasonal water stress, effectively canceling out any positive effects of an extended growing period[@buermann_widespread_2018; ] or inducing the cessation of stem growth when a critical water deficit is reached[@lempereur_growth_2015].  

Spring warming at SCBI and Harvard Forest in the study years used here did not result in increased $\Delta DBH$ or summer water stress (SPEI; Supp(?) SPEI Figure). This suggests that even when warmer springs are not associated with greater seasonal water stress, the lack of increased stem growth still prevails at these sites. This could be because the woody growth at these sites are already limited by some mechanism. 

The concept that stem growth is not enhanced under a longer growing season was supported by our tree-ring analysis, which showed that the effect of spring temperatures on annual growth is negligible for most species and locations, with at most modest influence for some species and locations (Fig. `r tree_rings`, `r EDF_tree_rings_TMIN`)[@alexander_potential_2019; @helcoski_growing_2019].
Rather, the primary effect of temperature on annual growth is a negative effect of $T_{max}$ during the peak growing season, which is most likely a signal of drought stress[@dorangeville_drought_2018].
Linear models were run to examine the relationship between spring, summer and an interaction effect with ring-width for each of our 208 chronologies. The results indicated that, across all latitudes, the interacting effect of warmer springs and summers resulted in negligible increase of ring-width (supp (?) rw_drought_plot).  
*It is possible that an earlier start to the growing season may provide some buffer against drought later in the growing season[@wolf_warm_2016], potentially contributing to observed trends of declining drought sensitivity in the region[@maxwell_declining_2016;@helcoski_growing_2019; @zhang_drought_2021]. (Is this relevent?)*(Neil suggested that the zhang paper would be good here but i'm not sure I see how...)
*(ADD MORE ON DROUGHT HERE)*

Our finding that interannual variation in woody growth is more strongly linked to conditions during the peak growing season than to growing season length aligns with parallel findings for NEE [@zhou_explaining_2016; @fu_maximum_2019].
However, there is also a disconnect between the woody growth responses to spring temperatures observed here and parallel studies on NEE implying that annual C sequestration increases -- at least modestly -- with spring temperatures[@keenan_net_2014] or with the length of the carbon uptake period[@zhou_explaining_2016; @fu_maximum_2019].
We show that the extra C does not go into woody growth, raising the question of where this C goes.

There are two main possibilities, which hold contrasting implications for the response of forest C balance to rising spring temperatures.
First, C that is fixed in late summer or fall may be used for woody growth that is not apparent from diameter measurements in the current year: either used for thickening of cell walls, a process that lags behind stem expansion[@cuny_woody_2015], or saved within trees as non-structural carbohydrates and used towards growth the following year[@trumbore_quantifying_2002;@richardson_seasonal_2013].
In fact, [extension of our tree-ring analysis](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/issues/57) showed a generally positive, although often non-significant, correlation between ring-width and previous year growing season $T_{max}$ in RP trees, indicating this may be a possibility. *very little correlation between April $T_{max}$ and growth the following year (5 of 142 RP and 3 of 66 DP species-site combinations), refuting the latter possibility*.
We also cannot rule out the possibility that warm springs promote formation of more carbon-dense cell walls in the current of following year (**coauthors, do any of you know literature related to this?**); however, our results suggest that little of the extra C that may be fixed in these years goes into wood formation.

A second possibility is that any additional C fixed during years with warm springs that is not rapidly respired may be allocated, potentially in the following growing season, to plant functions other than stem growth, including respiration, reproduction, foliage, fine roots, or root exudates[@trumbore_quantifying_2002]. 
Stem growth is more sensitive to water deficit than is photosynthesis[@muller_water_2011]. [This seems to promote the investment of sequestered carbon into root growth in times of drought stress. Zoehner et al 2021[@zohner_how_2021] found that the proportion of root-to-stem growth increased under spring warming, suggesting that increased ecosystem sequestration resulting from spring warming may be promoting the growth of below-ground biomass. ~~However, this study was done under tightly controlled conditions within potted plants and does not represent the environmental conditions of forests.~~](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/issues/72)
Most of this carbon would have a relatively low residence time in the ecosystem[@trumbore_quantifying_2002], although a small fraction would be incorporated into soil organic carbon pools *with residence times rivaling that of wood [REFS]*.
Notably, turnover of extra C fixed during years with warm springs would often occur with sufficient temporal lag that it would not be captured in interannual variation in NEE, implying that the long-term effect of lengthened growing season on NEE may not be captured in studies that consider time frames of a year or less[@zhou_explaining_2016; @fu_maximum_2019].
Studies examining long-term trends in growing season length and ecosystem C uptake[@keeling_increased_1996;@dragoni_evidence_2011;@keenan_net_2014] -- as opposed to their interannual variation -- within or including the temperate deciduous biome showed increasing trends in both variables, suggesting that the C not allocated to current year growth may have a *fairly long* residence time within the ecosystem; however, the amount and fate of this carbon remains unknown.

Thus, a distinction between interannual variation and directional change may be critical when considering how directional climate change is likely to affect tree growth and ecosystem C dynamics. 
In addition to the existence of temporal lags between C uptake and release, which introduce a lot of uncertainty[@trumbore_quantifying_2002], trees are likely to  acclimate *to some extent* to warming temperatures[@zhang_drought_2021; @gessler_way_2020], and on even longer time scales, we are likely to see changes in forest composition and adaptation.
If we look across spatial gradients where the latter have had time to play out, we see that longer growing seasons are correlated with greater tree growth[**REF?**], woody productivity[@banburymorgan_global_2021], and NEE [@churkina_spatial_2005].
*Future research will be important to sorting this out.*

Despite remaining uncertainties, our findings contribute substantially to a broader picture of the influence of spring temperatures on forest ecosystem function. 
Warm spring temperatures result in earlier leaf-out (Fig. `r DOY_timing`)[@jeong_phenology_2011], an earlier start to net C sequestration[@keenan_net_2014], and, as shown here, earlier initiation of stem growth (Figs. `r schematic_summary`, `r EDF_pheno_Tmax_climwin`).
Yet, an earlier start to the growing season is not consistently associated with a longer peak growing season or increased growth (Figs. `r schematic_summary`, `r tree_rings`), presumably because stem diameter growth is curtailed by C sink limitation[@zani_increased_2020] or drought[@zhang_drought_2021;@dorangeville_drought_2018;@helcoski_growing_2019].

As climate change accelerates and spring temperatures become increasingly warmer, growing seasons will start earlier, but this is unlikely to provide the sustained increase in carbon sequestration that is anticipated in most models (Fig. `r schematic_summary`)[@zani_increased_2020].
Because of this, temperate deciduous forests are likely to sequester less CO~2~ than most models suggest, implying that these models are underestimating future overall atmospheric CO~2~.

*We have not yet re-written the methods for Nature. Nature guidelines: Full methods, typically not exceeding 3000 words. May be subdivided by bold headings.*

## Study sites {-#Study} 

Study sites included two temperate forests in the eastern United States, both part of the Forest Global Earth Observatory [ForestGEO; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2015; Davies et al. 2021]. 

Our first study site was the forest dynamics plot located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute 5 km South of Front Royal, Virginia within the Blue Ridge Mountains (38.8935° N, 78.1454° W; elevation 273–338 m.a.s.l.). 
The forest here was established in the mid-19th century after conversion from agricultural fields. 
Dominate canopy species within the 25.6 ha forest plot include tulip poplar (*Liriodendron tulipifera*), oaks (*Quercus spp.*), and hickories (*Carya spp.*). 
The climate is humid temperate, with a mean annual precipitation of 998 mm and temperatures averaging 1° C in January and 24° C in July ([helcoski_growing_2019]).  

The second study site was Harvard Forest (42.5388° N, 72.1755° W, 340-368 m.a.s.l.), located near the central Massachusetts town of Petersham.
Harvard forest is a secondary forest, having re-established following agricultural use *(time frame)* and significant hurricane damage in 1938. 
Dominate species within the 35 ha ForestGEO plot are hemlock (*Tsuga canadensis*), oak (*Quercus spp.*) and red maple (*Acer rubrum*). 
The climate is temperate continental with a mean annual precipitation of 1120 mm and temperatures  averaging -12° C in January and 19° C in July (D'Orangeville et al, ).

## Data collection and preparation {-#Data} 
### Dendrometer bands {-#Dendrometer} 

Metal dendrometer bands were installed on a total of `r n_dendro_trees` trees within the SCBI and Harvard Forest ForestGEO plots (`r  EDT_species`). 
Bands were placed on dominant species, including two diffuse- and two ring-porous species at SCBI and eight diffuse- and three ring-porous species at Harvard Forest.
Bands were measured with a digital caliper approximately every 1-2 weeks within the growing season from 2011-2020 at SCBI and 1998-2003 at Harvard Forest. 
The number of bands measured at each site fluctuated somewhat as trees were added or dropped (e.g., because of tree mortality) from the census. 
Across years, the number of bands sampled averaged *~135* (range: 99-145) at SCBI and  *~717* (range: *700-755*) at Harvard Forest. 
In total, our analysis included `r n_tree_years` tree-years (`r  EDT_species`).


Measurements were timed to begin before the beginning of spring growth and to continue through the cessation of growth in the fall. 
At SCBI, the median start date was 4/14, which was adjusted when early leaf-out of understory vegetation was observed, with the earliest start date being March 30, 2020. Measurements were continued through to fall leaf senescence, with the median end date being 10/17 and the latest end date November 26, 2012. 
Timing of measurements at Harvard Forest were similar, with the median start date of 4/23 and median end date of 10/30. 1998 was an anomalous year where initial measurements were taken on 1/5, but not taken again until 4/15. The latest end date was November 11, 2002.

The raw dendrometer band data were manually cleaned by visual inspection before analysis. 
We screened for three classes of mistakes. 
First, when a weekly measurement was drastically different from previous week and following weeks, this was assumed to be a measurement error and the record was removed.
Second, when measurements remained essentially unchanged for several readings, followed by a sudden jump then return to a normal growth pattern, this was assumed to be a case where the band was stuck and then released. In these cases, the full annual record for the tree was removed.
Third, cases where data were clearly wrong but with unknown causes were removed. If a majority of the data points fell into this class the entire year was removed from the analysis.

We fit the model of @mcmahon_general_2015 to define phenological dates and growth rates (Fig. `r schematic_summary`). 
This five-parameter logistic model was fitted to dendrometer band data from each tree-year in R: 
$$ DBH = L + \frac{K - L} { 1 + 1/\theta \cdot exp[-r(DOY - DOY_{ip}) / \theta)] ^ \theta}$$ 
Here, $L$ and $K$ are lower and upper asymptotes of the model, corresponding to $DBH$ at the beginning and end of the year, respectively. 
$DOY$ are the modeled days of year (*i.e.*, julian days), 
$DOY_{ip}$ is the day of year where the inflection point in growth rate occurs,
$r$ *shapes the slope of the curve at the inflection point*,
and $\theta$ is a tuning parameter controlling the slope of the curve toward the upper asymptote. 
*We note that the DOY on which maximum growth occurs, $DOY_{g_{max}}$ (Fig. `r schematic_summary`) occurs on $DOY_{ip}$ only when $\theta = 1$.*
Using the optimized parameters for each tree-year, we then modeled $DBH$ throughout the year and extracted the intra-annual growth variables of interest (Fig. `r schematic_summary`). 

After fitting the @mcmahon_general_2015 model, we removed poorly fit models. 
Models were judged to be poorly fit if certain modeled growth characteristics fell outside of the acceptable range we determined. 
Modeled fits for tree-years were removed under five conditions:
(1) single day growth rates were higher than 2 standard deviations away from the mean for each wood-type (SCBI = 2, Harvard Forest = 34); 
(2) $DOY_{ip}$ was $\ge 2$ standard deviations away from the mean for it's xylem architecture group, year, and site (SCBI = 62, Harvard Forest = 106); 
(3) tree-years with small or negligible total growth ($\Delta DBH$ < 0.02 mm; SCBI = 0, Harvard Forest = 66); 
(4) model fit predicted total yearly growth to take longer than 365 days, indicating poor model fit (SCBI = 181, Harvard Forest = 199); 
and (5) models with unexplained sharp spikes in growth rate (SCBI = 0, Harvard Forest = 3). 
At Harvard Forest the tag years removed through this method were proportional to the original sample size, indicating that no species or size class was disproportionately removed compared to others *(SI figure? data_cleaning_figure_hf in manuscript folder)*. 
At SCBI a higher proportion of RP trees were removed--the majority in step 4 *(data_cleaning_figure_scbi)*. 

### Leaf phenology

Leaf phenology data for the years 2001-2018 were extracted for SCBI and Harvard Forest from the MCD12Q2 V6 Land Cover Dynamics product (informally called the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product) [@friedl_mcd12q2_2019].

### Tree rings {-#Tree} 
Dominant tree species were cored at both sites following sampling designs that covered a broad range of $DBH$.
We analyzed records for the dominant ring- and diffuse- porous species at each site (`r  EDT_species`), excluding species with other xylem architectures (*Juglans nigra* L. at SCBI, *Tsuga canadensis* (L.) Carrière at Harvard Forest)
At SCBI, cores were collected as described in @helcoski_growing_2019. 
Briefly, cores were taken from living or recently dead trees $\ge$ 10 cm $DBH$, including a randomly sampled subset of all dominant species within the ForestGEO plot [live trees in 2010-2011; @bourg_initial_2013] and trees found newly dead in annual tree mortality in 2016 and 2017 [@helcoski_growing_2019]*(If we're citing a method from the helcoski paper, do we need to do this 'briefly' section? I would remove.)*.
At Harvard Forest, ...(*Neil can write this easily, or KAT probably has the info*)
In total, we analyzed `r n_cores_focal_sites` cores from eleven species at SCBI and three species at Harvard Forest (`r  EDT_species`).

The tree-ring records from our focal sites were complemented with a much larger collection spanning `r n_cores_sites-2` deciduous and mixed forest sites in Eastern North America[@maxwell_sampling_2020;@dorangeville_drought_2018] (**OTHER REFS??**).
Again, species were limited to broadleaf deciduous species with clearly defined xylem porosity (i.e., excluding semi-ring porous). 


All cores were mounted, sanded, cross-dated, and measured using standard methodology. 
We standardized ring-width series from each core via ARSTAN using a 2/3rds $n$ spline, where $n$ is the number of years in the series [@cook_time_1985; @cook_methods_1990]. 
*(The following italic text is self-plagarized from Helcoski and needs to be reworded:)* *The influence of outliers in all series was reduced using the adaptive power transformation, which also stabilises the variance over time [@cook_calculating_1997]. Next, each series was stabilised using either the average correlation between raw ring-width series (rbar) method or a 1/3rds spline method to adjust changes in variance as series replication decreased towards the earlier portion of each chronology [@jones_estimating_1997]. The 1/3rds spline method was chosen when replication in the inner portion of each chronology (c. the inner 30–50 yr of each record depending on full chronology length) dropped below three trees. Once that step was complete, a robust biweight mean chronology for each species was calculated from the ring-width indices [@cook_time_1985]. We chose to use residual chronologies because the autoregressive standardisation process in creating them removes much of the tree-level autocorrelation in growth and these chronologies would most likely contain the most conservative information on drivers of interannual growth [@cook_time_1985].* 
We defined chronology start year (`r  EDT_species`) as the year where subsample signal strength (SSS) passed a threshold of SSS = 0.8, or where $\ge$ 80% of the population signal was captured in the chronology.

### Climate {-#Climate} 
For the dendrometer band analysis, we used climate data from local weather stations. 
Daily maximum and minimum temperatures ($T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$, respectively) for SCBI were obtained from a meteorological tower adjacent to the SCBI ForestGEO plot, via the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal v1.0 [https://forestgeo.github.io/Climate/; @anderson-teixeira_forestgeo_2020]. 
Daily temperature records for Harvard Forest were obtained from the Harvard Forest weather station (Boose & Gould, 2004; Boose, 2018).
The R package climpact () was used to plot temperatures for visual inspection. 
Climpact also identifies readings that were greater than 3 standard deviations away from yearly means. These points were labeled as outliers and removed from the dataset. 
Gaps in the SCBI meteorological tower data were subsequently filled using temperature readings obtained from a National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) weather station located in Front Royal, Virginia (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00443229/detail). 
(*how were gaps filled for Harvard? Or was the record good?*)

For the tree-ring analysis, we obtained monthly $T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$ data for 1901-2019 from CRU v.4.04 [@harris_version_2020], again via the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal v1.0 [@anderson-teixeira_forestgeo_2020].

## Analyses
### Determining critical temperature windows {-#Determining} 

The period where the phenology milestone(s) were most affected by changes in early spring temperature was determined using the R package *climwin* [@vandepol_identifying_2016]. 
This package tests the correlation between one or more climate variables and a biological variable over all consecutive time windows within a specified time-frame, reporting correlation and $\Delta AIC$ of each window. 
Here, we tested for correlation between temperature ($T_{max}$, $T_{min}$) and $DOY_{25}$ over the time window from January 1 to the mean $DOY_{25}$ for the species group and site (`r  EDT_mean_growth_parameters`).
*The critical time window is determined based on the subset of models that fall within the 95% confidence set.*
Here, we focused on defining critical temperature windows for $DOY_{25}$, as opposed to other growth phenology parameters (Figure `r schematic_summary`), because we were interested in the influence of temperature on the initiation of woody growth. 
We note that other growth parameters would be controlled by different critical temperature windows; for example, at SCBI $\Delta DBH$ responds most strongly to May-July climate [@helcoski_growing_2019]. Determining the climate variables that most strongly control all parameters is beyond the scope of this analysis.


### Hypothesis testing {-#Hypothesis} 

(*This section needs work/ more detail.*)

Correlation between these variables and spring temperatures were assessed using a linear mixed model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.

Mixed effects models were used to test the response of growth phenology variables ($DOY_{25}$, $DOY_{50}$, $DOY_{75}$, $DOY_{g_max}$, $g_{max}$, and $\Delta DBH$) to fixed effects of xylem porosity and mean temperature ($T_{max}$, $T_{min}$) during the critical temperature window selected by *climwin*, along with random effects of species and tree. 
We ran separate models for each species group at each site, and for the response of all growth phenology variables to $T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$. 
Models were run using the LME4 package in R [@bates_fitting_2015]. 

This mixed-effect model was run within a hierarchical Bayesian framework and fit using the `rstanarm` R interface to the Stan programming language @rstanarm_2020. In all cases unless otherwise specified, all prior distributions are set to be the weakly informative defaults.
