  abstract = {We have investigated the spatio-temporal carbon balance patterns resulting from forcing a dynamic global vegetation model with output from 18 climate models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) ensemble. We found robust patterns in terms of an extra-tropical loss of carbon, except for a temperature induced shift in phenology, leading to an increased spring uptake of carbon. There are less robust patterns in the tropics, a result of disagreement in projections of precipitation and temperature. Although the simulations generally agree well in terms of the sign of the carbon balance change in the middle to high latitudes, there are large differences in the magnitude of the loss between simulations. Together with tropical uncertainties these discrepancies accumulate over time, resulting in large differences in total carbon uptake over the coming century (-0.97\textendash 2.27 Pg C yr-1 during 2006\textendash 2100). The terrestrial biosphere becomes a net source of carbon in ten of the 18 simulations adding to the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, while the remaining eight simulations indicate an increased sink of carbon.},

  abstract = {Background. Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Methods/Design. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world's forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types \textendash{} tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age {$<$}100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. Review Results/ Synthesis. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. Discussion. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.},

  abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25~ha), all stems {$\geq$}1~cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25\textdegree S\textendash 61\textdegree N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61~\textdegree C), changes in precipitation (up to {$\pm$}30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8~g N~m-2~yr-1 and 3.1~g S~m-2~yr-1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5~km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

  abstract = {Tree rings provide an invaluable long-term record for understanding how climate and other drivers shape tree growth and forest productivity. However, conventional tree-ring analysis methods were not designed to simultaneously test effects of climate, tree size, and other drivers on individual growth. This has limited the potential to test ecologically relevant hypotheses on tree growth sensitivity to environmental drivers and their interactions with tree size. Here, we develop and apply a new method to simultaneously model nonlinear effects of primary climate drivers, reconstructed tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and calendar year in generalized least squares models that account for the temporal autocorrelation inherent to each individual tree's growth. We analyze data from 3811 trees representing 40 species at 10 globally distributed sites, showing that precipitation, temperature, DBH, and calendar year have additively, and often interactively, influenced annual growth over the past 120 years. Growth responses were predominantly positive to precipitation (usually over {$\geq$} 3-month seasonal windows) and negative to temperature (usually maximum temperature, over {$\leq$} 3-month seasonal windows), with concave-down responses in 63\% of relationships. Climate sensitivity commonly varied with DBH (44\% of cases tested), with larger trees usually more sensitive. Trends in ring width at small DBH were linked to the light environment under which trees established, but basal area or biomass increments consistently reached maxima at intermediate DBH. Accounting for climate and DBH, growth rate declined over time for 92\% of species in secondary or disturbed stands, whereas growth trends were mixed in older forests. These trends were largely attributable to stand dynamics as cohorts and stands age, which remain challenging to disentangle from global change drivers. By providing a parsimonious approach for characterizing multiple interacting drivers of tree growth, our method reveals a more complete picture of the factors influencing growth than has previously been possible.},

Results from the fully and biogeochemically coupled simulations in which CO2 increases at a rate of 1\,\%\,yr-1 (1pctCO2) from its preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of carbon\textendash concentration and carbon\textendash climate feedback parameters which measure the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate, respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The strength of the carbon\textendash concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes over land (mean\,{$\pm$}\,standard deviation\,=\,0.97\,{$\pm$}\,0.40\,PgC\,ppm-1) and ocean (0.79\,{$\pm$}\,0.07\,PgC\,ppm-1), while the carbon\textendash climate feedback over land (-45.1\,{$\pm$}\,50.6\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (-17.2\,{$\pm$}\,5.0\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is 1.77\,{$\pm$}\,0.37\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1 and is similar to that found in CMIP5 models (1.63\,{$\pm$}\,0.48\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1) but with somewhat reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation are simplified when the small temperature change in the biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon cycle models.},

In many parts of the eastern United States (US), more xeric-adapted oak-hickory dominated stands are being replaced with mesic beech-maple assemblages. To examine the possible impacts of this ongoing change in forest composition, we investigated how two wide-ranging and co-occurring eastern US species \textendash{} Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Quercus alba (white oak) \textendash{} respond to interannual climate variability. Using 781 tree cores from 418 individual trees at 18 locations, we found late-growing season drought reduced A. saccharum growth more than that of Q. alba. A gradient in the growth reduction across latitude was also found in A. saccharum, where southern populations of A. saccharum experienced greater reductions in growth during drought. Drought had a legacy effect on growth for both species, with drought occurring later in the growing season having a larger legacy effect. Consequently, as forests shift from oak to maple dominance, drought in the later part of the growing season is likely to become an increasingly important control on forest productivity. Thus, our findings suggest that co-occurring species are responding to environmental conditions during different times in the growing season and, therefore, the timing of drought conditions will play an important role in forest productivity and carbon sequestration as forest species composition changes. These findings are particularly important because the projected increases in potential evapotranspiration, combined with possible changes in the seasonality of precipitation could have a substantial impact on how tree growth responds to future climatic change.},

By assessing and statistically scaling the climatic drivers from 2710 tree-ring sites, we identified the boreal and temperate land areas where tree growth during 1930\textendash 1960 CE responded positively to temperature (20.8 {$\pm$} 3.7 Mio km               2               ; 25.9 {$\pm$} 4.6\%), precipitation (77.5 {$\pm$} 3.3 Mio km               2               ; 96.4 {$\pm$} 4.1\%), and other parameters.

However, while many studies have considered variation in productivity with latitude and climate, we lack a cohesive synthesis on how forest carbon fluxes vary globally with respect to climate and one another. Here, we draw upon 1,319 records from the Global Forest Carbon Database, representing all major forest types and the nine most significant autotrophic carbon fluxes, to comprehensively review how annual C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. Across all flux variables analyzed, rates of C cycling decreased continuously with absolute latitude\textemdash a finding that confirms multiple previous studies and contradicts the idea that net primary productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests. C flux variables generally displayed similar trends across latitude and multiple climate variables, with no differences in allocation detected at this global scale. Temperature variables in general, and mean annual temperature or temperature seasonality in particular, were the best single predictors of C flux, explaining 19\%\textendash 71\% of variation in the C fluxes analyzed. The effects of temperature were modified by moisture availability, with C flux reduced under hot and dry conditions and sometimes under very high precipitation. Annual C fluxes increased with growing season length and were also influenced by growing season climate. These findings clarify how forest C flux varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. In an era when forests will play a critical yet uncertain role in shaping Earth's rapidly changing climate, our synthesis provides a foundation for understanding global patterns in forest C cycling.},

During the last three decades, the thermal potential growing season has lengthened by about 10.5 days (P {$<$} 0.01, 1982\textendash 2011), which is unprecedented in the context of the past 60 years. The overall lengthening has been stronger and more significant in Eurasia (12.6 days, P {$<$} 0.01) than North America (6.2 days, P {$>$} 0.05). The photosynthetic growing season has closely tracked the pace of warming and extension of the potential growing season in spring, but not in autumn when factors such as light and moisture limitation may constrain photosynthesis. The autumnal extension of the photosynthetic growing season since 1982 appears to be about half that of the thermal potential growing season, yielding a smaller lengthening of the photosynthetic growing season (6.7 days at the circumpolar scale, P {$<$} 0.01). Nevertheless, when integrated over the growing season, photosynthetic activity has closely followed the interannual variations and warming trend in cumulative growing season temperatures. This lengthening and intensification of the photosynthetic growing season, manifested principally over Eurasia rather than North America, is associated with a long-term increase (22.2\% since 1972, P {$<$} 0.01) in the amplitude of the CO2 annual cycle at northern latitudes. The springtime extension of the photosynthetic and potential growing seasons has apparently stimulated earlier and stronger net CO2 uptake by northern ecosystems, while the autumnal extension is associated with an earlier net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. These contrasting responses may be critical in determining the impact of continued warming on northern terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle.},

The objective of this article is to describe computing options that provide flexible and robust use of the SPEI. In particular, we present methods for estimating the parameters of the log-logistic distribution for obtaining standardized values, methods for computing reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and weighting kernels used for calculation of the SPEI at different time scales. We discuss the use of alternative ET0 and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) methods and different options on the resulting SPEI series by use of observational and global gridded data. The results indicate that the equation used to calculate ET0 can have a significant effect on the SPEI in some regions of the world. Although the original formulation of the SPEI was based on plotting-positions Probability Weighted Moment (PWM), we now recommend use of unbiased PWM for model fitting. Finally, we present new software tools for computation and analysis of SPEI series, an updated global gridded database, and a real-time drought-monitoring system.},

  abstract = {Spring phenology of temperate forest trees has advanced substantially over the last decades due to climate warming, but this advancement is slowing down despite continuous temperature rise. The decline in spring advancement is often attributed to winter warming, which could reduce chilling and thus delay dormancy release. However, mechanistic evidence of a phenological response to warmer winter temperatures is missing. We aimed to understand the contrasting effects of warming on plants leaf phenology and to disentangle temperature effects during different seasons. With a series of monthly experimental warming by ca. 2.4\textdegree C from late summer until spring, we quantified phenological responses of forest tree to warming for each month separately, using seedlings of four common European tree species. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we tracked the development of dormancy depth under ambient conditions as well as directly after each experimental warming. In addition, we quantified the temperature response of leaf senescence. As expected, warmer spring temperatures led to earlier leaf-out. The advancing effect of warming started already in January and increased towards the time of flushing, reaching 2.5 days/\textdegree C. Most interestingly, however, warming in October had the opposite effect and delayed spring phenology by 2.4 days/\textdegree C on average; despite six months between the warming and the flushing. The switch between the delaying and advancing effect occurred already in December. We conclude that not warmer winters but rather the shortening of winter, i.e., warming in autumn, is a major reason for the decline in spring phenology.},

The plot is in mature secondary mixed deciduous forest 5 km south of Front Royal, Virginia, USA. The initial plot census enumerated 38 932 free-standing living stems and 29 991 living individuals {$\geq$}1 cm dbh comprising 62 species, 38 genera, and 26 families, along with an additional 1248 dead/missing standing stems, for a total of 40 180 stems. Dominant canopy trees include tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), hickories (Carya spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black gum (Nyssa sylvatica). Prominent understory components include spicebush (Lindera benzoin), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis). Few species predominate numerically on the plot; seven species have {$>$}1000 individuals (71.3\% of the total). Mean stand density was 1179 living individuals/ha, while mean basal area was 34.1 m2/ha. Of the total plot area, 4 ha have had white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exclusion since 1990. Woody seedling surveys from 2010\textendash 2012 in 354 1-m2 plots measured 19 415 seedlings of 47 species, from new germinants up to 1 cm dbh. Community-wide seed rain data from 200 0.5-m2 litterfall traps yielded a total of 9197 records from 37 species. Long-term seed data collected from 1986\textendash 2011 for Quercus and Carya within the exclosure and two replicate sites are also presented, documenting considerable annual variation in mast production. Dendrochronological data from 492 tree cores suggested the major canopy trees established circa 1900, but scattered trees of several species existed earlier. Large-scale forest dynamics plots employing standardized methodology have a long, rich history in the tropics. Similar plots in the temperate zone have been largely lacking, however. The SCBI plot represents one of the first of its kind in the Smithsonian Global Earth Observatory's recently established network of such plots, complementing its well-known network of tropical forest plots and enabling comparative studies on forest ecology and climate change at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Using data from 28 flux measurement sites, we performed an analysis of the relationship between annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the length of the carbon uptake period (CUP) (the number of days when the ecosystem is a net carbon sink). The observations suggest a linear correlation between the two quantities. The change in annual carbon exchange per day of the CUP differs significantly between deciduous and evergreen vegetation types. The sites containing vegetation with short-lived foliage (less than 1 year) have higher carbon uptake and respiration rates than evergreen vegetation. The ratio between mean daily carbon exchange rates during carbon uptake and release periods is relatively invariant (2.73{$\pm$}1.08) across different vegetation types. This implies that a balance between carbon release and uptake periods exists despite different photosynthetic pathways, life forms, and leaf habits. The mean daily carbon sequestration rate for these ecosystems never exceeds the carbon emission rate by more than a factor of 3. Growing season lengths for the study sites were derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of advanced very-high-resolution radiometer and from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of VEGETATION SPOT-4. NDVI and EVI were found to be closely related to the CUP, and consequently they also can be used to approximate annual carbon exchange of the ecosystems. This approach has potential for allowing extrapolation of NEE over large areas from remotely sensed data, given a certain amount of ancillary information. This method could complement the currently existing techniques for extrapolation, which rely upon modeling of the individual gross fluxes.},

Based on measurements of ecosystem CO2 flux, radiation absorption by plants, crop yields and a model simulating the terrestrial biosphere, a multinational team of researchers has found that during July and August 2003, 500 million tonnes of carbon escaped from the forests and fields across Europe as a result of extreme heat and drought. The model results and historical data suggest that this dramatic fall in primary productivity is unprecedented during the past century. If the incidence of extreme droughts like this were to increase, temperate ecosystems could become carbon sources with the potential to accelerate global warming, as has been anticipated for the tropics.},

  abstract = {In dendroclimatology, tree-ring indices are traditionally calculated as part of the tree-ring chronology development process. This is accomplished by fitting a growth curve to the ring-width series and using it as a series of expectations for more or less well specified null conditions (uniform climate perhaps) of annual radial growth. The ratio of the actual ring widths to these expectations produces a set of dimensionless indices that can be averaged arithmetically with cross-dated indices from other trees into a mean chronology suitable for studies of climatic and environmental change. We show that tree-ring indices calculated in this manner can be systematically biased. The shape of this bias is defined by the reciprocal of the growth curve used to calculate the indices, and its magnitude depends on the proximity of the growth curve to the time axis and its intercept. The underlying cause, however, is lack of fit. To avoid this bias, residuals from the growth curve, rather than ratios, can be computed. If this is done, in conjunction with appropriate transformations to stabilize the variance, the resulting tree-ring chronology will not be biased in the way that ratios can be. This bias problem is demonstrated in an annual tree-ring chronology of bristlecone pine from Campito Mountain, which has been used previously in global change studies. We show that persistent growth increase since AD 1900 in that series is over-estimated by 23.6\% on average when ratios are used instead of residuals, depending on how the ring widths are transformed. Such bias in ratios is not always serious, as it depends on the joint behaviour of the growth curve and data, particularly near the ends of the data interval. Consequently, ratios can still be used safely in many situations. However, to avoid the possibility of ratio bias problems, we recommend that variance-stabilized residuals be used.},

Traditionally, methods of tree-ring analysis, or more properly in this case methods 0/ dendrochronology, were developed and used for dating archaeological and historical structures and for reconstructing past climates. The classic book Tree Rings and Climate, by H.C. Fritts, published in 1976, provided a superb introduction to the science and an in-depth description of techniques useful for extracting climatic information from tree rings. This book, which was published by Academic Press, is sadly out of print and, even though only 12 years old, lim\- ited in its methods and applications. This is owing to the extremely rapid development of the science since the 1970s. Only recently have tree rings as environmental sensors been fully recog\- nized as a valuable tool in detecting environmental change. For example, tree\- ring measurements have been critically important in studies of forest decline in Europe and North America. There are also attempts to use tree-ring analysis for ecological prognosis to solve large-scale regional problems including the sustain\- ability of water supplies, prediction of agricultural crops, and adoption of silvi\- cultural measures in response to ecological changes. More speculatively, dendro\- chronological methods are also used for dating and evaluating some astrophysical phenomena and for indicating possible increase in the biospheric carrying capac\- ity due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  abstract = {The problem of standardizing closed-canopy forest ringwidth series is investigated. A biological model for the tree-ring standardization problem indicated that one class of non-climatic variance frequently responsible for standardization problems could be objectively minimized in theory. This is the variance caused by endogenous stand disturbances which create fluctuations in ringwidth series that are non-synchronous or out-of-phase when viewed across trees in a stand. A time series method based on the autoregressive process is developed which minimizes the timewise influence of endogenous disturbances in detrended ringwidth series. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) properties of this method are derived which indicate that autoregressive modelling and prewhitening of detrended ringwidth indices will result in a higher SNR when endogenous disturbances are present in the series. This enables the verification of the SNR theory and the error variance reduction property of the standardization method.},

  abstract = {Recent climate warming has shifted the timing of spring and autumn vegetation phenological events in the temperate and boreal forest ecosystems of Europe. In many areas spring phenological events start earlier and autumn events switch between earlier and later onset. Consequently, the length of growing season in mid and high latitudes of European forest is extended. However, the lagged effects (i.e. the impact of a warm spring or autumn on the subsequent phenological events) on vegetation phenology and productivity are less explored. In this study, we have (1) characterised extreme warm spring and extreme warm autumn events in Europe during 2003\textendash 2011, and (2) investigated if direct impact on forest phenology and productivity due to a specific warm event translated to a lagged effect in subsequent phenological events. We found that warmer events in spring occurred extensively in high latitude Europe producing a significant earlier onset of greening (OG) in broadleaf deciduous forest (BLDF) and mixed forest (MF). However, this earlier OG did not show any significant lagged effects on autumnal senescence. Needleleaf evergreen forest (NLEF), BLDF and MF showed a significantly delayed end of senescence (EOS) as a result of extreme warm autumn events; and in the following year's spring phenological events, OG started significantly earlier. Extreme warm spring events directly led to significant (p=0.0189) increases in the productivity of BLDF. In order to have a complete understanding of ecosystems response to warm temperature during key phenological events, particularly autumn events, the lagged effect on the next growing season should be considered.},

  abstract = {The phenology of wood formation is a critical process to consider for predicting how trees from the temperate and boreal zones may react to climate change. Compared to leaf phenology, however, the determinism of wood phenology is still poorly known. Here, we compared for the first time three alternative ecophysiological model classes (threshold models, heat-sum models and chilling-influenced heat-sum models) and an empirical model in their ability to predict the starting date of xylem cell enlargement in spring, for four major Northern Hemisphere conifers (Larix decidua, Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Picea mariana). We fitted models with Bayesian inference to wood phenological data collected for 220 site-years over Europe and Canada. The chilling-influenced heat-sum model received most support for all the four studied species, predicting validation data with a 7.7-day error, which is within one day of the observed data resolution. We conclude that both chilling and forcing temperatures determine the onset of wood formation in Northern Hemisphere conifers. Importantly, the chilling-influenced heat-sum model showed virtually no spatial bias whichever the species, despite the large environmental gradients considered. This suggests that the spring onset of wood formation is far less affected by local adaptation than by environmentally driven plasticity. In a context of climate change, we therefore expect rising winter\textendash spring temperature to exert ambivalent effects on the spring onset of wood formation, tending to hasten it through the accumulation of forcing temperature, but imposing a higher forcing temperature requirement through the lower accumulation of chilling.},

  abstract = {Temperate and boreal forests undergo drastic functional changes in the springtime, shifting within a few weeks from net carbon (C) sources to net C sinks. Most of these changes are mediated by temperature. The autumn 2006\textendash winter 2007 record warm period was followed by an exceptionally warm spring in Europe, making spring 2007 a good candidate for advances in the onset of the photosynthetically active period. An analysis of a decade of eddy covariance data from six European forests stands, which encompass a wide range of functional types (broadleaf evergreen, broadleaf deciduous, needleleaf evergreen) and a wide latitudinal band (from 44\textdegree{} to 62\textdegree N), revealed exceptional fluxes during spring 2007. Gross primary productivity (GPP) of spring 2007 was the maximum recorded in the decade examined for all sites but a Mediterranean evergreen forest (with a +40 to +130 gC m-2 anomaly compared with the decadal mean over the January\textendash May period). Total ecosystem respiration (TER) was also promoted during spring 2007, though less anomalous than GPP (with a +17 to +93 gC m-2 anomaly over 5 months), leading to higher net uptake than the long-term mean at all sites (+12 to +79 gC m-2 anomaly over 5 months). A correlative analysis relating springtime C fluxes to simple phenological indices suggested spring C uptake and temperatures to be related. The CASTANEA process-based model was used to disentangle the seasonality of climatic drivers (incoming radiation, air and soil temperatures) and biological drivers (canopy dynamics, thermal acclimation of photosynthesis to low temperatures) on spring C fluxes along the latitudinal gradient. A sensitivity analysis of model simulations evidenced the roles of (i) an exceptional early budburst combined with elevated air temperature in deciduous sites, and (ii) an early relief of winter thermal acclimation in coniferous sites for the promotion of 2007 spring assimilation.},

We analysed a 9-yr time series of carbon fluxes and aboveground wood growth (AWG), reconstructed at a weekly time-scale through the combination of dendrometer and wood density data. Carbon inputs and AWG anomalies appeared to be uncorrelated from the seasonal to interannual scales. More than 90\% of the interannual variability of AWG was explained by a combination of the growth intensity during a first `critical period' of the wood growing season, occurring close to the seasonal maximum, and the timing of the first summer growth halt. Both atmospheric and soil water stress exerted a strong control on the interannual variability of AWG at the study site, despite its mesic conditions, whilst not affecting carbon inputs. Carbon sink activity, not carbon inputs, determined the interannual variations in wood growth at the study site. Our results provide a functional understanding of the dependence of radial growth on precipitation observed in dendrological studies.},

We show the first detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) estimates of the volume and AGB of large coastal redwood Sequoia sempervirens trees from three sites in Northern California, representing some of the highest biomass ecosystems on Earth. Our TLS estimates agree to within 2\% AGB with a species-specific model based on detailed manual crown mapping of 3D tree structure. However TLS-derived AGB was more than 30\% higher compared to widely-used general (non species-specific) allometries. We derive an allometry from TLS that spans a much greater range of tree size than previous models and so is potentially better-suited for use with new Earth Observation data for these exceptionally high biomass areas. We suggest that where possible, TLS and crown mapping should be used to provide complementary, independent 3D structure measurements of these very large trees.},

  abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors\textemdash the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)\textemdash are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and {$\psi$}50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

  abstract = {Climate models project warmer summer temperatures will increase the frequency and heat severity of droughts in temperate forests of Eastern North America. Hotter droughts are increasingly documented to affect tree growth and forest dynamics, with critical impacts on tree mortality, carbon sequestration and timber provision. The growing acknowledgement of the dominant role of drought timing on tree vulnerability to water deficit raises the issue of our limited understanding of radial growth phenology for most temperate tree species. Here, we use well-replicated dendrometer band data sampled frequently during the growing season to assess the growth phenology of 610 trees from 15 temperate species over 6 years. Patterns of diameter growth follow a typical logistic shape, with growth rates reaching a maximum in June, and then decreasing until process termination. On average, we find that diffuse-porous species take 16\textendash 18~days less than other wood-structure types to put on 50\% of their annual diameter growth. However, their peak growth rate occurs almost a full month later than ring-porous and conifer species (ca. 24~{$\pm~$}4~days; mean~{$\pm~$}95\% credible interval). Unlike other species, the growth phenology of diffuse-porous species in our dataset is highly correlated with their spring foliar phenology. We also find that the later window of growth in diffuse-porous species, coinciding with peak evapotranspiration and lower water availability, exposes them to a higher water deficit of 88~{$\pm~$}19~mm (mean~{$\pm~$}SE) during their peak growth than ring-porous and coniferous species (15~{$\pm~$}35~mm and 30~{$\pm~$}30~mm, respectively). Given the high climatic sensitivity of wood formation, our findings highlight the importance of wood porosity as one predictor of species climatic sensitivity to the projected intensification of the drought regime in the coming decades.},

Thus, this is one of the few deciduous forest sites in the world, where a decadal analysis on net ecosystem productivity (NEP) trends is possible. Despite the large interannual variability in NEP, the observations show a significant increase in forest productivity over the past 10 years (by an annual increment of about 10 g C m-2 yr-1). There is evidence that this trend can be explained by longer vegetative seasons, caused by extension of the vegetative activity in the fall. Both phenological and flux observations indicate that the vegetative season extended later in the fall with an increase in length of about 3 days yr-1 for the past 10 years. However, these changes are responsible for only 50\% of the total annual gain in forest productivity in the past decade. A negative trend in air and soil temperature during the winter months may explain an equivalent increase in NEP through a decrease in ecosystem respiration.},

We studied daily radial growth of 160 individuals of seven temperate tree species at 47 sites across Switzerland over 8 years. Growth of all species peaked in the early part of the growth season and commenced shortly before the summer solstice, but with species-specific seasonal patterns. Day length set a window of opportunity for radial growth. Within this window, the probability of daily growth was constrained particularly by air and soil moisture, resulting in intermittent growth to occur only on 29 to 77 days (30\% to 80\%) within the growth period. The number of days with growth largely determined annual growth, whereas the growth period length contributed less. We call for accounting for these non-linear intra-annual and species-specific growth dynamics in tree and forest models to reduce uncertainties in predictions under climate change.},

  abstract = {How, where, and why carbon (C) moves into and out of an ecosystem through time are long-standing questions in biogeochemistry. Here, we bring together hundreds of thousands of C-cycle observations at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA, a mid-latitude landscape dominated by 80\textendash 120-yr-old closed-canopy forests. These data answered four questions: (1) where and how much C is presently stored in dominant forest types; (2) what are current rates of C accrual and loss; (3) what biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variability in these rates; and (4) how has climate change affected the forest's C cycle? Harvard Forest is an active C sink resulting from forest regrowth following land abandonment. Soil and tree biomass comprise nearly equal portions of existing C stocks. Net primary production (NPP) averaged 680\textendash 750 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1; belowground NPP contributed 38\textendash 47\% of the total, but with large uncertainty. Mineral soil C measured in the same inventory plots in 1992 and 2013 was too heterogeneous to detect change in soil-C pools; however, radiocarbon data suggest a small but persistent sink of 10\textendash 30 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. Net ecosystem production (NEP) in hardwood stands averaged 300 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. NEP in hemlock-dominated forests averaged 450 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1 until infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid turned these stands into a net C source. Since 2000, NPP has increased by 26\%. For the period 1992\textendash 2015, NEP increased 93\%. The increase in mean annual temperature and growing season length alone accounted for 30\% of the increase in productivity. Interannual variations in GPP and NEP were also correlated with increases in red oak biomass, forest leaf area, and canopy-scale light-use efficiency. Compared to long-term global change experiments at the Harvard Forest, the C sink in regrowing biomass equaled or exceeded C cycle modifications imposed by soil warming, N saturation, and hemlock removal. Results of this synthesis and comparison to simulation models suggest that forests across the region are likely to accrue C for decades to come but may be disrupted if the frequency or severity of biotic and abiotic disturbances increases.},

  abstract = {Temperate and boreal forests are forecast to change in composition and shift spatially in response to climate change. Local-scale expansions and contractions are most likely observable near species range limits, and as trees are long-lived, initial shifts are likely to be detected in the understory regeneration layers. We examined understory relative abundance patterns of naturally regenerated temperate and boreal tree species in two size classes, seedlings and saplings, and across two spatial scales, local stand-scale ecotones (tens of meters) and the regional temperate\textendash boreal transition zone (\texttildelow 250 km) in central North America, to explore indications of climate-mediated shifts in regeneration performance. We also tested for the presence of strong environmental gradients across local ecotones that might inhibit species expansion. Results showed that tree regeneration patterns across ecotones varied by species and size class, and varied across the regional summer temperature gradient. Temperate tree species regeneration has established across local ecotones into boreal forest patches and this process was facilitated by warmer temperatures. Conversely, boreal conifer regeneration exhibited negative responses to the regional temperature gradient and only displayed high abundance at the boreal end of local ecotones at cool northern sites. The filtering effects of temperature also increased with individual size for both boreal and temperate understory stems. Observed regeneration patterns and the minor environmental gradients measured across local ecotones failed to support the idea that there were strong barriers to potential temperate tree expansion into boreal forest patches. Detectable responses, consistently in the directions predicted for both temperate and boreal species, indicate that summer temperature is likely an important driver of natural tree regeneration in forests across the temperate\textendash boreal transition zone. Regeneration patterns point toward temperate expansion and reduced but continued boreal presence in the near-future, resulting in local and regional expansions of mixed temperate-boreal forests.},

The historical climate-growth response of trees provides insight into how a species may respond to future changes in climate and also enables us to understand how drought and the timing of drought has impacted growth. In this study, we use dendrochronology to examine the climate and drought response of Quercus myrtifolia Willd. growth on sites from three different scrub ridge systems in central Florida. Five site chronologies and a regional chronology were created from tree-ring measurements. Growth of Q. myrtifolia correlated positively with spring precipitation and the standardized precipitation index (SPI). March, April, May, and June SPI explained 21.5 to 58.3\% of the variance in growth of Q. myrtifolia. The growth response of Q. myrtifolia to spring SPI was similar between sites, with the exception of Malabar West, where Q. myrtifolia occurred on poorly-drained soils. Seasonal droughts explained more of the variation in Q. myrtifolia growth than annual droughts. Spring droughts significantly decreased Q. myrtifolia growth at all sites, and summer droughts significantly reduced growth during the subsequent year at one site. Our data suggest that spring drought is the climatic limiting factor for Q. myrtifolia growth.}

For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\textdegree{} and 1.5\textdegree C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {$\pm$}1\emph{{$\sigma$}}. For the last decade available (2010\textendash 2019), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was 9.6\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.6\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the same decade, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of -0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade.

The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} relative to 2019 of about -7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of -6\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\% (-3\&thinsp;\% to -11\&thinsp;\%), and -13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\textendash 2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean.

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (E\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (G\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{OCEAN}) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{LAND}) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (B\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \&plusmn;1\&sigma;. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our E\textsubscript{LUC} estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries\&rsquo; climate progress.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}For the year 2020, E\textsubscript{FOS} declined by 5.4\&thinsp;\% relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} (9.3\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), E\textsubscript{LUC} was 0.9\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, for a total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emission of 10.2\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} (37.4\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;2.9\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}).

The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm.

They estimate plant growth as the outcome of the supply of carbon through photosynthesis. However, growth is itself under direct control, and not simply controlled by the amount of available carbon. Therefore predictions by current photosynthesis-driven models of large increases in future vegetation biomass due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2may be significant over-estimations. We describe how current understanding of wood formation can be used to reformulate global vegetation models, with potentially major implications for their behaviour.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems contribute most of the interannual variability (IAV) in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but processes driving the IAV of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) remain elusive. For a predictive understanding of the global C cycle, it is imperative to identify indicators associated with ecological processes that determine the IAV of NEE. Here, we decompose the annual NEE of global terrestrial ecosystems into their phenological and physiological components, namely maximum carbon uptake (MCU) and release (MCR), the carbon uptake period (CUP), and two parameters, {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}, that describe the ratio between actual versus hypothetical maximum C sink and source, respectively. Using long-term observed NEE from 66 eddy covariance sites and global products derived from FLUXNET observations, we found that the IAV of NEE is determined predominately by MCU at the global scale, which explains 48\% of the IAV of NEE on average while {$\alpha$}, CUP, {$\beta$}, and MCR explain 14\%, 25\%, 2\%, and 8\%, respectively. These patterns differ in water-limited ecosystems versus temperature- and radiation-limited ecosystems; 31\% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of CUP in water-limited ecosystems, and 60\% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of MCU in temperature- and radiation-limited ecosystems. The Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) model and the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Inter-comparison Project (MsTMIP) models underestimate the contribution of MCU to the IAV of NEE by about 18\% on average, and overestimate the contribution of CUP by about 25\%. This study provides a new perspective on the proximate causes of the IAV of NEE, which suggest that capturing the variability of MCU is critical for modeling the IAV of NEE across most of the global land surface.},

An earlier start of the thermal growing season promoted growth in regions with high ratios of precipitation to temperature but limited growth in cold\textendash dry regions. Path analyses indicated that an earlier start of the thermal growing season enhanced growth primarily by alleviating thermal limitations on wood formation in boreal forests and by lengthening the period of growth in temperate and Mediterranean forests. Semi-arid and dry subalpine forests, however, did not benefit from an earlier onset of growth and a longer growing season, presumably due to associated water loss and/or more frequent early spring frosts. These emergent patterns of how climatic impacts on wood phenology affect tree growth at regional to hemispheric scales hint at how future phenological changes may affect the carbon sequestration capacity of extratropical forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, but the amount of carbon they contain and its spatial distribution remain uncertain. Recent studies suggest that once tree height is accounted for in biomass calculations, in addition to diameter and wood density, carbon stock estimates are reduced in many areas. However, it is possible that larger crown sizes might offset the reduction in biomass estimates in some forests where tree heights are lower because even comparatively short trees develop large, well-lit crowns in or above the forest canopy. While current allometric models and theory focus on diameter, wood density, and height, the influence of crown size and structure has not been well studied. To test the extent to which accounting for crown parameters can improve biomass estimates, we harvested and weighed 51 trees (11\textendash 169 cm diameter) in southwestern Amazonia where no direct biomass measurements have been made. The trees in our study had nearly half of total aboveground biomass in the branches (44\% {$\pm$} 2\% [mean {$\pm$} SE]), demonstrating the importance of accounting for tree crowns. Consistent with our predictions, key pantropical equations that include height, but do not account for crown dimensions, underestimated the sum total biomass of all 51 trees by 11\% to 14\%, primarily due to substantial underestimates of many of the largest trees. In our models, including crown radius greatly improves performance and reduces error, especially for the largest trees. In addition, over the full data set, crown radius explained more variation in aboveground biomass (10.5\%) than height (6.0\%). Crown form is also important: Trees with a monopodial architectural type are estimated to have 21\textendash 44\% less mass than trees with other growth patterns. Our analysis suggests that accounting for crown allometry would substantially improve the accuracy of tropical estimates of tree biomass and its distribution in primary and degraded forests.},

If this ecosystem is typical of northern biomes, interannual climate variations on seasonal time scales may modify annual CO2 exchange in the Northern Hemisphere by 1 gigaton of carbon or more each year.},

We used continent-wide datasets of tree-ring chronologies and annual reproductive effort in Fagus sylvatica from 1901 to 2015 to characterise relationships between climate, reproduction and growth. Results highlight that variable allocation to reproduction is a key factor for growth in this species, and that high reproductive effort (`mast years') is associated with stem growth reduction. Additionally, high reproductive effort is associated with previous summer temperature, creating lagged climate effects on growth. Consequently, understanding growth variability in forest ecosystems requires the incorporation of reproduction, which can be highly variable. Our results suggest that future response of growth dynamics to climate change in this species will be strongly influenced by the response of reproduction.},

In this study, we use long stand-level records of annual seed production, radial growth (tree ring width) and meteorological conditions to analyse the relative importance of summer drought and reproductive effort in controlling the growth of Fagus sylvatica L., a typical masting species. We show that both summer drought and reproductive effort (masting) influenced growth. Importantly, the effects of summer drought and masting were interactive, with the greatest reductions in growth found in years when high reproductive effort (i.e., mast years) coincided with summer drought. Conversely, mast years that coincided with non-drought summers were associated with little reduction in radial growth, as were drought years that did not coincide with mast years. The results show that the strength of an inferred trade-off between growth and reproduction in this species (the cost of reproduction) is dependent on environmental stress, with a stronger trade-off in years with more stressful growing conditions. These results have widespread implications for understanding interannual variability in growth, and observed relationships between growth and climate.},

To date, several forest carbon monitoring systems have been developed for different regions using various data, methods and assumptions, making it difficult to evaluate mitigation performance consistently across scales. Here, we integrate ground and Earth observation data to map annual forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and removals globally at a spatial resolution of 30\,m over the years 2001\textendash 2019. We estimate that global forests were a net carbon sink of -7.6\,{$\pm$}\,49\,GtCO2e\,yr-1, reflecting a balance between gross carbon removals (-15.6\,{$\pm$}\,49\,GtCO2e\,yr-1) and gross emissions from deforestation and other disturbances (8.1\,{$\pm$}\,2.5\,GtCO2e\,yr-1). The geospatial monitoring framework introduced here supports climate policy development by promoting alignment and transparency in setting priorities and tracking collective progress towards forest-specific climate mitigation goals with both local detail and global consistency. Forest management for climate mitigation plans requires accurate data on carbon fluxes to monitor policy impacts. Between 2001 and 2019, forests were a net sink of carbon globally, although emissions from disturbances highlight the need to reduce deforestation in tropical countries.},

In Betula pubescens, B. pendula and Prunus padus vegetative buds were released from dormancy already in December, in Populus tremula in January, whereas in Alnus incana and A. glutinosa dormancy was not released until February. Thermal time (day degrees {$>$}0\textdegree C) to budburst decreased non-linearily with increasing duration of chilling (i. e. duration outdoors), and the slope of this relationship differed among species. The estimated effective base temperature for accumulation of thermal time varied from + 1\textdegree C in P. tremula to -4\textdegree C in P. padus. The use of 0\textdegree C as base temperature is recommended. Long days reduced the thermal time to budburst at all flushing temperatures (9, 15 and 21\textdegree C) in all the above species and in Corylus avellana, whereas Sorbus aucuparia and Rubus idaeus showed no daylength response. Since the chilling requirement of all species was far exceeded even in a winter with January-March temperatures 6.5\textdegree C above normal, it is concluded that under Scandinavian conditions, the main effect of climatic warming would be earlier budburst and, associated with that, a longer growing season and increased risk of spring frost injury.},

For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901\textendash 2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May\textendash July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980\textendash 2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

  abstract = {Wood formation consumes around 15\% of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions per year and plays a critical role in long-term sequestration of carbon on Earth. However, the exogenous factors driving wood formation onset and the underlying cellular mechanisms are still poorly understood and quantified, and this hampers an effective assessment of terrestrial forest productivity and carbon budget under global warming. Here, we used an extensive collection of unique datasets of weekly xylem tissue formation (wood formation) from 21 coniferous species across the Northern Hemisphere (latitudes 23 to 67\textdegree N) to present a quantitative demonstration that the onset of wood formation in Northern Hemisphere conifers is primarily driven by photoperiod and mean annual temperature (MAT), and only secondarily by spring forcing, winter chilling, and moisture availability. Photoperiod interacts with MAT and plays the dominant role in regulating the onset of secondary meristem growth, contrary to its as-yet-unquantified role in affecting the springtime phenology of primary meristems. The unique relationships between exogenous factors and wood formation could help to predict how forest ecosystems respond and adapt to climate warming and could provide a better understanding of the feedback occurring between vegetation and climate that is mediated by phenology. Our study quantifies the role of major environmental drivers for incorporation into state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs), thereby providing an improved assessment of long-term and high-resolution observations of biogeochemical cycles across terrestrial biomes.},

Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953\textendash 2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.}

Therefore, knowledge of growing seasons over the past decades is essential to predict ecosystem changes. In this study, the long-term changes in the growing seasons of temperate vegetation over the Northern Hemisphere were examined by analyzing satellite-measured normalized difference vegetation index and reanalysis temperature during 1982\textendash 2008. Results showed that the length of the growing season (LOS) increased over the analysis period; however, the role of changes at the start of the growing season (SOS) and at the end of the growing season (EOS) differed depending on the time period. On a hemispheric scale, SOS advanced by 5.2 days in the early period (1982\textendash 1999) but advanced by only 0.2 days in the later period (2000\textendash 2008). EOS was delayed by 4.3 days in the early period, and it was further delayed by another 2.3 days in the later period. The difference between SOS and EOS in the later period was due to less warming during the preseason (January\textendash April) before SOS compared with the magnitude of warming in the preseason (June\textendash September) before EOS. At a regional scale, delayed EOS in later periods was shown. In North America, EOS was delayed by 8.1 days in the early period and delayed by another 1.3 days in the later period. In Europe, the delayed EOS by 8.2 days was more significant than the advanced SOS by 3.2 days in the later period. However, in East Asia, the overall increase in LOS during the early period was weakened in the later period. Admitting regional heterogeneity, changes in hemispheric features suggest that the longer-lasting vegetation growth in recent decades can be attributed to extended leaf senescence in autumn rather than earlier spring leaf-out.},

Although evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong CO2 fertilization effect on biomass growth3\textendash 5, it is unclear whether mature forests respond to eCO2 in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands7\textendash 10, photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO2 without any apparent accompanying growth response, leaving the fate of additional carbon fixed under eCO2 unclear4,5,7\textendash 11. Here using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest responded to four years of eCO2 exposure. We show that, although the eCO2 treatment of +150 parts per million (+38 per cent) above ambient levels induced a 12 per cent (+247 grams of carbon per square metre per year) increase in carbon uptake through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, with increased soil respiration alone accounting for half of the total uptake surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO2, and challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on ubiquitous CO2 fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in global forests.},

Standard errors estimated at the grid-box level [SE2 = S2(1 - r)/(1 + (n - 1)r)] depend upon three parameters: the number of site records (n) within each box, the average interrecord correlation (r) between these sites, and the temporal variability (S2) of each grid-box temperature time series. For boxes without data (n = 0), estimates are made using values of S2 interpolated from neighboring grid boxes. Due to spatial correlation, large-scale standard errors in a regional-mean time series are not simply the average of the grid-box standard errors, but depend upon the effective number of independent sites (Neff) over the region. A number of assumptions must be made in estimating the various parameters, and these are tested with observational data and complementary results from multicentury control integrations of three coupled general circulation models (GCMs). The globally complete GCMs enable some assumptions to be tested in a situation where there are no missing data; comparison of parameters computed from the observed and model datasets are also useful for assessing the performance of GCMs. As most of the parameters are timescale dependent, the resulting errors are likewise timescale dependent and must be calculated for each timescale of interest. The length of the observed record enables uncertainties to be estimated on the interannual and interdecadal timescales, with the longer GCM runs providing inferences about longer timescales. For mean annual observed data on the interannual timescale, the 95\% confidence interval for estimates of the global-mean surface temperature since 1951 is 9p 0.12\textdegree C. Prior to 1900, the confidence interval widens to 9p 0.18\textdegree C. Equivalent values on the decadal timescale are smaller: 9p 0.10\textdegree C (1951-95) and 9p 0.16\textdegree C (1851-1900).}

  abstract = {Severe drought can cause lagged effects on tree physiology that negatively impact forest functioning for years. These ``drought legacy effects'' have been widely documented in tree-ring records and could have important implications for our understanding of broader scale forest carbon cycling. However, legacy effects in tree-ring increments may be decoupled from ecosystem fluxes due to (a) postdrought alterations in carbon allocation patterns; (b) temporal asynchrony between radial growth and carbon uptake; and (c) dendrochronological sampling biases. In order to link legacy effects from tree rings to whole forests, we leveraged a rich dataset from a Midwestern US forest that was severely impacted by a drought in 2012. At this site, we compiled tree-ring records, leaf-level gas exchange, eddy flux measurements, dendrometer band data, and satellite remote sensing estimates of greenness and leaf area before, during, and after the 2012 drought. After accounting for the relative abundance of tree species in the stand, we estimate that legacy effects led to 10\% reductions in tree-ring width increments in the year following the severe drought. Despite this stand-scale reduction in radial growth, we found that leaf-level photosynthesis, gross primary productivity (GPP), and vegetation greenness were not suppressed in the year following the 2012 drought. Neither temporal asynchrony between radial growth and carbon uptake nor sampling biases could explain our observations of legacy effects in tree rings but not in GPP. Instead, elevated leaf-level photosynthesis co-occurred with reduced leaf area in early 2013, indicating that resources may have been allocated away from radial growth in conjunction with postdrought upregulation of photosynthesis and repair of canopy damage. Collectively, our results indicate that tree-ring legacy effects were not observed in other canopy processes, and that postdrought canopy allocation could be an important mechanism that decouples tree-ring signals from GPP.},

In the far north the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, peak to trough, is between 15 and 20 parts per million by volume5. The annual amplitude diminishes southwards to about 3 p.p.m. near the Equator, owing to the diminishing seasonally of plant activity towards the tropics. In spite of atmospheric mixing processes, enough spatial variability is retained in the seasonal cycle of CO2 to reveal considerable regional detail in seasonal plant activity6. Here we report that the annual amplitude of the seasonal CO2 cycle has increased by 20\%, as measured in Hawaii, and by 40\% in the Arctic, since the early 1960s. These increases are accompanied by phase advances of about 7 days during the declining phase of the cycle, suggesting a lengthening of the growing season. In addition, the annual amplitudes show maxima which appear to reflect a sensitivity to global warming episodes that peaked in 1981 and 1990. We propose that the amplitude increases reflect increasing assimilation of CO2 by land plants in response to climate changes accompanying recent rapid increases in temperature.},

Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

In this study, we assess the inter-annual variability (IAV) of carbon uptake using annually resolved aboveground biomass increment (ABI) estimates from 272 pseudorandomly sampled trees at a long-term monitoring plot in the dry valley of the Valais in Switzerland. Over the 1950\textendash 2011 period, the mean ABI is 86.8 g C m-2 year-1 with an IAV of {$\pm$}31 \%. The IAV is largely driven by hydrological conditions throughout the water year from previous August to current August (r SPEI = 0.56; 1st differenced r = 0.75, p {$<$} 0.001). During extremely dry years (such as 1972, 1976, 1998, and 2011), the carbon accumulation was reduced up to 63 \% from the long-term mean. Furthermore, our analysis explores possible biases of annual ABI derived from manual band dendrometers in permanent plot inventories caused by water status related changes in tree size. During the snow breakage event in March 2012 and subsequent management activities, 17 \% of the standing biomass was killed. We estimate that the remaining trees will take \textasciitilde 16 years to make up for the loss of this disturbance, assuming a similar growth rate of the remaining trees as during the previous 60 years and that a potentially drier climate and the increased water availability for the remaining trees will balance each other. We demonstrate that well-replicated, representative tree-ring datasets have a huge potential to complement shorter-term and lower-resolution forest inventory monitoring data. Integrating tree-ring and plot data allow one to gain knowledge about annual changes in forest productivity even before monitoring started and help ecosystem managers to better adapt their strategies.},

  abstract = {In deciduous forests, spring leaf phenology controls the onset of numerous ecosystem functions. While most studies have focused on a single annual spring event, such as budburst, ecosystem functions like photosynthesis and transpiration increase gradually after budburst, as leaves grow to their mature size. Here, we examine the ``velocity of green-up,'' or duration between budburst and leaf maturity, in deciduous forest ecosystems of eastern North America. We use a diverse data set that includes 301 site-years of phenocam data across a range of sites, as well as 22 years of direct ground observations of individual trees and 3 years of fine-scale high-frequency aerial photography, both from Harvard Forest. We find a significant association between later start of spring and faster green-up: - 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.04 (slope {$\pm$} 1 SE) days change in length of green-up for every day later start of spring within phenocam sites, - 0.31 {$\pm$} 0.06 days/day for trees under direct observation, and - 1.61 {$\pm$} 0.08 days/day spatially across fine-scale landscape units. To explore the climatic drivers of spring leaf development, we fit degree-day models to the observational data from Harvard Forest. We find that the default phenology parameters of the ecosystem model PnET make biased predictions of leaf initiation (39 days early) and maturity (13 days late) for red oak, while the optimized model has biases of 1 day or less. Springtime productivity predictions using optimized parameters are closer to results driven by observational data (within 1\%) than those of the default parameterization (17\% difference). Our study advances empirical understanding of the link between early and late spring phenophases and demonstrates that accurately modeling these transitions is important for simulating seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity.},

This dendroecological study evaluated correlations between radial growth of tulip poplar and monthly, seasonal, and annual climate variables and how these correlations varied across time and spatial climate gradients. The strongest and most spatially consistent correlations were with climate variables related to site water balance, especially precipitation. Growth was positively correlated with climate variables related to site water balance during the months of May through July of the year the annual ring forms and during the previous year growing season and autumn. Growth was negatively correlated with prior year growing season maximum temperature, but positively correlated with prior winter minimum temperature. There was some evidence of temporal variation in growth\textendash climate associations between 1900 and 2016, but the climate variables with the strongest associations were consistent across different time periods. Correlations with climate variables related to water stress increased from east to west as precipitation decreased, but there was no spatial trend in correlations with growing season temperature from north to south as temperature increases. Strength of positive correlations with winter temperature increased from north to south. Growth of tulip poplar will likely be adversely affected if drought frequency or severity increases during the twenty-first century. Increased winter temperature would likely have a positive influence on growth during the subsequent growing season in some parts of the species range. Radial growth of tulip poplar is most affected by climate conditions during a narrow time period early in the growing season, similar to results obtained for multiple oak species and a few other diffuse-porous species in eastern North America. Simulation modelers might consider the phenology of these correlations to formulate more biologically realistic tree climate response functions.},

At the daily timescale, during periods of low temperature ({$<$} 5\textdegree C) and high water deficit ({$<$} -1.1 MPa), gross primary productivity and net ecosystem productivity remained positive whereas the stem increment was nil. Thus, stem increment appeared limited by drought and temperature rather than by carbon input.

The onset of growth (t0) was related to winter temperatures and the summer interruption of growth (t1) to a threshold {$\Psi$}pd value of -1.1 MPa.

For herbaceous plants, warming advanced both the start and end of aboveground growing season, resulting in an unchanged growing season length. In contrast, belowground phenophases (the start, end and length of the growing season) of herbaceous plants remained unchanged. For woody plants, climate warming did not affect any aboveground phenophases but extended their belowground growing season. Mismatches between above- and belowground phenology will strongly influence biomass allocation in plants, implying that terrestrial carbon cycling models based exclusively on aboveground responses are inaccurate.

While there has been mounting evidence of an advanced start of the growing season mostly due to elevated spring air temperatures, the mechanisms that control the end of the growing season (EOS) in most ecosystems remain relatively less well understood. Recently, a strong lagged control of EOS by growing season photosynthesis has been proposed, suggesting that more productive growing seasons lead to an earlier EOS. However, this relationship has not been extensively tested with in-situ observations across a variety of ecosystems. Here, we use observations from 40 eddy-covariance flux tower sites in temperate and boreal ecosystems in the northern hemisphere with more than 10 years of observations (594 site-years), ground observations of phenology, satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and three leaf senescence models to test the extent of a relationship between growing season photosynthesis and end of season senescence. The results suggest that there is no significant negative relationship between growing season photosynthesis and observed leaf senescence, flux-inferred EOS estimates, or remotely sensed phenological metrics, in most ecosystems. On the contrary, while we found negative effects of summer air temperatures and autumn vapor pressure deficit on EOS, more productive growing seasons were typically related to a later, not earlier, EOS. Our results challenge recent reports of carry-over effects of photosynthesis on EOS timing, and suggest those results may not hold over a large range of ecosystems.},

This indicates drought in the Ohio River Valley should be examined at a sub-regional level and suggests a need for a finer spatial representation of tree-ring chronologies in the Ohio Valley. Given the context of historical drought variability, the reconstructions suggest this region should be prepared for droughts that may be more severe and longer lasting than those recently observed.},

  abstract = {In the 45 years after legislation of the Clean Air Act, there has been tremendous progress in reducing acidic air pollutants in the eastern United States, yet limited evidence exists that cleaner air has improved forest health. Here, we investigate the influence of recent environmental changes on the growth and physiology of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees, a key indicator species of forest health, spanning three locations along a 100 km transect in the Central Appalachian Mountains. We incorporated a multiproxy approach using 75-year tree ring chronologies of basal tree growth, carbon isotope discrimination ({$\increment$}13C, a proxy for leaf gas exchange), and {$\delta$}15N (a proxy for ecosystem N status) to examine tree and ecosystem level responses to environmental change. Results reveal the two most important factors driving increased tree growth since ca. 1989 are reductions in acidic sulfur pollution and increases in atmospheric CO2, while reductions in pollutant emissions of NOx and warmer springs played smaller, but significant roles. Tree ring {$\increment$}13C signatures increased significantly since 1989, concurrently with significant declines in tree ring {$\delta$}15N signatures. These isotope chronologies provide strong evidence that simultaneous changes in C and N cycling, including greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of trees and increases in ecosystem N retention, were related to recent increases in red spruce tree growth and are consequential to ecosystem recovery from acidic pollution. Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of the red spruce trees increased by 51\% across the 75-year chronology, and was driven by changes in atmospheric CO2 and acid pollution, but iWUE was not linked to recent increases in tree growth. This study documents the complex environmental interactions that have contributed to the recovery of red spruce forest ecosystems from pervasive acidic air pollution beginning in 1989, about 15 years after acidic pollutants started to decline in the United States.},

Here, we investigate the ability of using multiple co-occurring canopy-dominant species from a single location for climate reconstructions based in the eastern United States. Using a variety of techniques, we first compare the climate signals of three canopy-dominant species (Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, Liriodendron tulipifera) at an old-growth forest in southern Indiana. We then determine if a composite time series of these co-occurring species increases or decreases the reconstruction model skill. Climate\textendash growth correlation analysis of the species reveals strong and consistent relationships with summer [June\textendash August (JJA)] Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the period 1895\textendash 2012. We first use a split-sample reconstruction technique to compare the performance of species reconstruction models. We then use a nested technique to build a composite chronology against which to compare the individual species chronologies. The composite chronology of all three species accounts for up to 38\% of the mean variation in JJA PDSI, and verification statistics indicate robust statistical skill from 1870 to 2012. The composite chronology reconstruction also outperforms each individual species model, indicating that using multiple co-occurring species increases reconstruction skill, at least from a single study site. Furthermore, model performance is improved by using nested reconstruction techniques, and implicates the potential ability to use multiple co-occurring species across multiple locations in the eastern United States.},

  abstract = {Several important environmental influences of tree growth and carbon sequestration have changed over the past several decades in eastern North America, specifically, more frequent pluvial conditions, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and decreased acidic deposition. These factors could lead to changes in the relationship between tree growth and water availability, and perhaps even decouple the two, having large implications on how future climate change will impact forest productivity and carbon sequestration. Here, we examine the concurrent influence of the climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration), CO2 concentrations, and sulfate and nitrogen deposition on radial tree growth, carbon isotopes, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) for several hardwood tree species in the Midwestern United States. We found that when considering the simultaneous influence of these factors, the climatic water balance is the dominant influence on annual growth. Therefore, the recent pluvial period is the primary cause of the weakening relationship between radial growth and water availability. Even during pluvial periods, water availability is the primary control on growth, with increasing CO2 concentrations and decreased SO4 deposition being secondary factors. Importantly, the weakening in the climate-growth relationship is species specific, with Acer species having stable relationships with the climatic water balance, Liriodendron tulipifera showing a strengthening relationship, and Quercus species and Populus grandidentata exhibiting weakening. Thus, interannual variations in soil moisture unevenly impact tree growth and carbon sequestration. Our findings suggest that, despite recent pluvial conditions, increasing CO2 concentrations and decreasing acidic deposition have not buffered the impact of water availability on tree growth and carbon sequestration.},

Tree rings have long provided historical context of hydroclimate variability of the U.S. However, the tree-ring network used to create these countrywide gridded reconstructions is sparse in certain locations, such as the Midwest. Here, we increase (n~=~20) the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network in southern Indiana and compare a summer (June\textendash August) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruction to existing gridded reconstructions of PDSI for this region. We find both droughts and pluvials that were previously unknown that rival the most intense PDSI values during the instrumental period. Additionally, historical drought occurred in Indiana that eclipsed instrumental conditions with regard to severity and duration. During the period 1962\textendash 2004 CE, we find that teleconnections of drought conditions through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation have a strong influence (r~=~-0.60, p~{$<~$}0.01) on secondary tree growth in this region for the late spring-early summer season. These findings highlight the importance of continuing to increase the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network used to infer past climate dynamics to capture the sub-regional spatial variability. Increasing the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network for a given region can better identify sub-regional variability, improve the accuracy of regional tree-ring PDSI reconstructions, and provide better information for climatic teleconnections.},

Large-scale soil moisture reconstructions from a network of tree-ring chronologies have greatly improved our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimate conditions, particularly extremes of both drought and pluvial (wet) events. However, certain regions within these large-scale network reconstructions in the US are modeled by few tree-ring chronologies. Further, many of the chronologies currently publicly available on the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were collected in the 1980s and 1990s, and thus our understanding of the sensitivity of radial growth to soil moisture in the US is based on a period that experienced multiple extremely severe droughts and neglects the impacts of recent, rapid global change. In this study, we expanded the tree-ring network of the Ohio River valley in the US, a region with sparse coverage. We used a total of 72 chronologies across 15 species to examine how increasing the density of the tree-ring network influences the representation of reconstructing the Palmer Meteorological Drought Index (PMDI). Further, we tested how the sampling date and therefore the calibration period influenced the reconstruction models by creating reconstructions that ended in the year 1980 and compared them to reconstructions ending in 2010 from the same chronologies. We found that increasing the density of the tree-ring network resulted in reconstructed values that better matched the spatial variability of instrumentally recorded droughts and, to a lesser extent, pluvials. By extending the calibration period to 2010 compared to 1980, the sensitivity of tree rings to PMDI decreased in the southern portion of our region where severe drought conditions have been absent over recent decades. We emphasize the need of building a high-density tree-ring network to better represent the spatial variability of past droughts and pluvials. Further, chronologies on the ITRDB need updating regularly to better understand how the sensitivity of tree rings to climate may vary through time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {As climate change drives increased drought in many forested regions, mechanistic understanding of the factors conferring drought tolerance in trees is increasingly important. The dendrochronological record provides a window through which we can understand how tree size and traits shape growth responses to droughts. We analyzed tree-ring records for 12 species in a broadleaf deciduous forest in Virginia (USA) to test hypotheses for how tree height, microenvironment characteristics, and species' traits shaped drought responses across the three strongest regional droughts over a 60-yr period. Drought tolerance (resistance, recovery, and resilience) decreased with tree height, which was strongly correlated with exposure to higher solar radiation and evaporative demand. The potentially greater rooting volume of larger trees did not confer a resistance advantage, but marginally increased recovery and resilience, in sites with low topographic wetness index. Drought tolerance was greater among species whose leaves lost turgor (wilted) at more negative water potentials and experienced less shrinkage upon desiccation. The tree-ring record reveals that tree height and leaf drought tolerance traits influenced growth responses during and after significant droughts in the meteorological record. As climate change-induced droughts intensify, tall trees with drought-sensitive leaves will be most vulnerable to immediate and longer-term growth reductions.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees' grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a finer understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions finer than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workflow to help forest ecologists fit growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal fits. We offer R code to implement this workflow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to fitting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we fit the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-specific patterns, and phenology.},

  abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971\textendash 2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade-1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days\textdegree C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day\textdegree C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P{$<$}0.001).},

  abstract = {In plants, carbon (C) molecules provide building blocks for biomass production, fuel for energy, and exert signalling roles to shape development and metabolism. Accordingly, plant growth is well correlated with light interception and energy conversion through photosynthesis. Because water deficits close stomata and thus reduce C entry, it has been hypothesised that droughted plants are under C starvation and their growth under C limitation. In this review, these points are questioned by combining literature review with experimental and modelling illustrations in various plant organs and species. First, converging evidence is gathered from the literature that water deficit generally increases C concentration in plant organs. The hypothesis is raised that this could be due to organ expansion (as a major C sink) being affected earlier and more intensively than photosynthesis (C source) and metabolism. How such an increase is likely to interact with C signalling is not known. Hence, the literature is reviewed for possible links between C and stress signalling that could take part in this interaction. Finally, the possible impact of water deficit-induced C accumulation on growth is questioned for various sink organs of several species by combining published as well as new experimental data or data generated using a modelling approach. To this aim, robust correlations between C availability and sink organ growth are reported in the absence of water deficit. Under water deficit, relationships weaken or are modified suggesting release of the influence of C availability on sink organ growth. These results are interpreted as the signature of a transition from source to sink growth limitation under water deficit.},

  abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a `systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates `very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that tree growth is sink-limited by environmental and internal controls rather than by carbon availability. However, the mechanisms underlying sink-limitations are not fully understood and thus not represented in large-scale vegetation models. We develop a simple, analytically solved, mechanistic, turgor-driven growth model (TDGM) and a phloem transport model (PTM) to explore the mechanics of phloem transport and evaluate three hypotheses. First, phloem transport must be explicitly considered to accurately predict turgor distributions and thus growth. Second, turgor-limitations can explain growth-scaling with size (metabolic scaling). Third, turgor can explain realistic growth rates and increments. We show that mechanistic, sink-limited growth schemes based on plant turgor limitations are feasible for large-scale model implementations with minimal computational demands. Our PTM predicted nearly uniform sugar concentrations along the phloem transport path regardless of phloem conductance, stem water potential gradients and the strength of sink-demands contrary to our first hypothesis, suggesting that phloem transport is not limited generally by phloem transport capacity per se but rather by carbon demand for growth and respiration. These results enabled TDGM implementation without explicit coupling to the PTM, further simplifying computation. We test the TDGM by comparing predictions of whole-tree growth rate to well-established observations (site indices) and allometric theory. Our simple TDGM predicts realistic tree heights, growth rates and metabolic scaling over decadal to centurial timescales, suggesting that tree growth is generally sink and turgor limited. Like observed trees, our TDGM captures tree-size- and resource-based deviations from the classical {$\frac{3}{4}$} power-law metabolic scaling for which turgor is responsible.},

  abstract = {Wood products are considered to contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. A critical gap in the life cycle of wood products is to transfer the raw timber from the forest to the processing wood industry and, thus, the primary wood products. Therefore, often rough estimates are used for this step to obtain total forestry carbon balances. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the fate of timber harvested in Thuringian state forests (central Germany), representing a large, intensively managed forested region, and (2) to quantify carbon stocks and the lifetime of primary wood products made from this timber. The analyses were based on the amount and assortments of actually sold timber, and production parameters of the companies that bought and processed this timber. In addition, for coniferous stands of a selected Thuringian forest district, we calculated potential effects of management, as expressed by different thinning regimes on wood products and their lifetimes. Total annual timber sale of soft- and hardwoods from Thuringian state forests (195,000~ha) increased from about 136,893~t~C (\textasciitilde 0.7~t~C~ha-1~year-1) in 1996 to 280,194~t~C (\textasciitilde 1.4~t~C~ha-1~year-1) in 2005. About 47\% of annual total timber harvest went into short-lived wood products with a mean residence time (MRT)~{$<~$}25 years. Thirty-one per cent of the total harvest went into wood products with an MRT of 25\textendash 43~years, and only 22\% was used as construction wood and glued wood, products with the longest MRT (50 years). The average MRT of carbon in harvested wood products was 20~years. Thinning from above throughout the rotation of spruce forests would lead to an average MRT in harvested wood products of about 23~years, thinning from below of about 18 years. A comparison of our calculations with estimates that resulted from the products module of the CO2FIX model (Nabuurs et al. 2001) demonstrates the influence of regional differences in forest management and wood processing industry on the lifetime of harvested wood products. To our knowledge, the present study provides for the first time real carbon inputs of a defined forest management unit to the wood product sector by linking data on raw timber production, timber sales and wood processing. With this new approach and using this data, it should be possible to substantially improve the net-carbon balance of the entire forestry sector.},

It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981\textendash 2010. For 2001\textendash 2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66\textendash 0.96) Pg year               -1               located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03\textendash 1.96) Pg year               -1               located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44\textendash 131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981\textendash 2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.},

We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch and sugars) concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated the mean age of the starch and sugars in a subset of trees using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike. With these data, we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes in a process-based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season, lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon-based estimates indicated that the mean age of the starch and sugars in red maple (Acer rubrum) was 7\textendash 14 yr. A two-pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool, and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment, compared with zero- or one-pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {Phenology, by controlling the seasonal activity of vegetation on the land surface, plays a fundamental role in regulating photosynthesis and other ecosystem processes, as well as competitive interactions and feedbacks to the climate system. We conducted an analysis to evaluate the representation of phenology, and the associated seasonality of ecosystem-scale CO2 exchange, in 14 models participating in the North American Carbon Program Site Synthesis. Model predictions were evaluated using long-term measurements (emphasizing the period 2000\textendash 2006) from 10 forested sites within the AmeriFlux and Fluxnet-Canada networks. In deciduous forests, almost all models consistently predicted that the growing season started earlier, and ended later, than was actually observed; biases of 2 weeks or more were typical. For these sites, most models were also unable to explain more than a small fraction of the observed interannual variability in phenological transition dates. Finally, for deciduous forests, misrepresentation of the seasonal cycle resulted in over-prediction of gross ecosystem photosynthesis by +160 {$\pm$} 145 g C m-2 yr-1 during the spring transition period and +75 {$\pm$} 130 g C m-2 yr-1 during the autumn transition period (13\% and 8\% annual productivity, respectively) compensating for the tendency of most models to under-predict the magnitude of peak summertime photosynthetic rates. Models did a better job of predicting the seasonality of CO2 exchange for evergreen forests. These results highlight the need for improved understanding of the environmental controls on vegetation phenology and incorporation of this knowledge into better phenological models. Existing models are unlikely to predict future responses of phenology to climate change accurately and therefore will misrepresent the seasonality and interannual variability of key biosphere\textendash atmosphere feedbacks and interactions in coupled global climate models.},

We compared a 37-year ring width chronology collected at NOBS to a second chronology that was collected at a nearby Black Spruce stand with a different disturbance history, and also to three measures of annual whole-forest photosynthesis [gross ecosystem production (GEP)], two measures of annual respiration (R), and one measure of annual carbon balance [net ecosystem production (NEP)]. The year-to-year ring width fluctuations were well correlated between the two sites; increasing our confidence in the NOBS chronology and implying that ring width variation is driven and synchronized by the physical environment. Both chronologies exhibited serial correlation, with a fluctuation in ring width that had an apparent periodicity of {$\sim$}7 years. Neither chronology was correlated with variation in annual precipitation or temperature. Ring width and NEP increased, while R decreased from 1995 to 2004. GEP either remained constant or decreased from 1995 to 2004, depending on which measure was considered. The lack of relationship between ring width and GEP may indicate that ring growth is controlled almost entirely by something other than carbon uptake. Alternative explanations for the ring width chronologies include the possibility that wood production varies as a result of shifts in respiration, or that an unidentified aspect of the environment, rather than the balance between GEP and respiration, controls wood production. The serial correlation in ring width may be related to increases and decreases in carbohydrate pools, or to gradual changes in nutrient availability, pathogens, herbivores, soil frost or soil water table. The cause or causes of serial correlation, and the controls on the allocation of photosynthate to wood production, emerge as critical uncertainties for efforts in predicting the carbon balance of boreal ecosystems and inferring past climate from tree rings.},

For this, 18 ash and 26 oak trees were cored from the Dobrușa protected area, Republic of Moldova, Eastern Europe, and new EW, LW, and RW chronologies were developed for ash and oak covering the last century. The obtained results showed that the RW and LW have a similar climatic response for both species, while EW is capturing interannual climate variations and has a different reaction. The analyses performed with monthly climatic data revealed a significant and negative correlation with the mean air temperature and a significant and positive correlation with precipitation and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for both ash and oak. The temperature during the vegetation period has a strong influence on all tree-ring components of ash, while for oak the strong correlation was found only for LW. The positive and significant correlation between LW and RW with precipitation for both species, suggests that ash and oak are sensitive to the hydrological component and the precipitation is the main tree growth-limiting factor. Despite the significant correlation with precipitation and temperature for the whole analyzed period, the 25-year moving correlation analyses show that they are not stable in time and can switch from positive to negative or vice versa, while the correlation with SPEI3 drought index, which is a integration of both climatic parameters, is stable in time. By employing the stability map analysis, we show that oak and ash tree ring components, from the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova, have a stable and significant correlation with SPEI3 and scPDSI drought indices from February (January) until September, over the eastern part of Europe.},

Location Ten European and Canadian sites at different latitudes and altitudes. Methods The periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation were assessed on a weekly time-scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected over 2 to 5 years per site from 1998 to 2005 from the stems of seven conifer species. All data were compared with daily air temperatures recorded from weather stations located close to the sites. Logistic regressions were used to calculate the probability of xylogenesis and of cambium being active at a given temperature. Results Xylogenesis lasted from May to October, with a growing period varying from 3 to 5 months depending on location and elevation. Despite the wide geographical range of the monitored sites, temperatures for onset and ending of xylogenesis converged towards narrow ranges with average values around 4\textendash 5, 8\textendash 9 and 13\textendash 14 \textdegree C for daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature, respectively. On the contrary, cell division in the cambium stopped in July-August, when temperatures were still high. Main conclusions Wood formation in conifers occurred when specific critical temperatures were reached. Although the timing and duration of xylogenesis varied among species, sites and years, the estimated temperatures were stable for all trees studied. These results provide biologically based evidence that temperature is a critical factor limiting production and differentiation of xylem cells in cold climates. Although daily temperatures below 4-5 \textdegree C are still favourable for photosynthesis, thermal conditions below these values could inhibit the allocation of assimilated carbon to structural investment, i.e. xylem growth.},

Specifically, there is a dearth of information regarding the residence time of downed woody debris (DWD), which may be reflected in the diversity of wood (for example, species, size, and stage of decay) and site attributes (for example, climate) across the study region of eastern US forests. The empirical assessment of DWD rate of decay and residence time is complicated by the decay process itself, as decomposing logs undergo not only a reduction in wood density over time but also reductions in biomass, shape, and size. Using DWD repeated measurements coupled with models to estimate durations in various stages of decay, estimates of DWD half-life (THALF), residence time (TRES), and decay rate (k constants) were developed for 36 tree species common to eastern US forests. Results indicate that estimates for THALF averaged 18 and 10 years for conifers and hardwoods, respectively. Species that exhibited shorter THALF tended to display a shorter TRES and larger k constants. Averages of TRES ranged from 57 to 124 years for conifers and from 46 to 71 years for hardwoods, depending on the species and methodology for estimating DWD decomposition considered. Decay rate constants (k) increased with increasing temperature of climate zones and ranged from 0.024 to 0.040 for conifers and from 0.043 to 0.064 for hardwoods. These estimates could be incorporated into dynamic global vegetation models to elucidate the role of DWD in forest C dynamics.},

  abstract = {Heatwaves exert disproportionately strong and sometimes irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems. These impacts remain poorly understood at the tree and species level and across large spatial scales. Here, we investigate the effects of the record-breaking 2018 European heatwave on tree growth and tree water status using a collection of high-temporal resolution dendrometer data from 21 species across 53 sites. Relative to the two preceding years, annual stem growth was not consistently reduced by the 2018 heatwave but stems experienced twice the temporary shrinkage due to depletion of water reserves. Conifer species were less capable of rehydrating overnight than broadleaves across gradients of soil and atmospheric drought, suggesting less resilience toward transient stress. In particular, Norway spruce and Scots pine experienced extensive stem dehydration. Our high-resolution dendrometer network was suitable to disentangle the effects of a severe heatwave on tree growth and desiccation at large-spatial scales in situ, and provided insights on which species may be more vulnerable to climate extremes.},

  abstract = {In seasonally cold climates, many woody plants tolerate chilling and freezing temperatures by ceasing growth, shedding leaves and entering dormancy. At the same time, transport within these plants often decreases as the vascular system exhibits reduced functionality. As spring growth requires water and nutrients, we ask the question: how much does bud, leaf and flower development depend on the vasculature in spring? In this review, we present what is known about leaf, flower and vascular phenology to sort out this question. In early stages of bud development, buds rely on internal resources and do not appear to require vascular support. The situation changes during organ expansion, after leaves and flowers reconnect to the stem vascular system. However, there are major gaps in our understanding of the timing of vascular development, especially regarding the phloem, as well as the synchronization among leaves, flowers, stem and root vasculature. We believe these gaps are mainly the outcome of research completed in silo and urge future work to take a more integrative approach. We highlight current challenges and propose future directions to make rapid progress on this important topic in upcoming years.},

  abstract = {The use of tree ring widths as indicators of water resource availability affords annual- scale resolution in the reconstruction of streamflow prior to the limited instrumental record. While an abundance of streamflow reconstructions have been conducted in the western United States, few have been undertaken in the eastern half of the country. This study aims to enhance understanding of regional hydroclimate in the Great Lakes region by presenting a 325-year streamflow reconstruction for the St. Joseph River, as well as contributing two new tree ring-width chronologies in Indiana and Michigan. A variety of factors potentially influencing the chance of successful streamflow reconstruction are also posited and discussed. A total of 55 tree ring width chronologies from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario were examined using standard methods in  dendrochronology and nested principal component analysis (PCA) to reconstruct St. Joseph River streamflow to 1675 with greater skill than climatology. The resulting overall reconstruction and periods identified as severe droughts and pluvials were in general agreement with other dendroclimatological studies in the eastern U.S. The findings suggest that the instrumental record (beginning in 1924) does not accurately depict long-term streamflow variability of the St. Joseph River. The reconstructed values tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of pluvial periods, but also show that droughts in the region were of similar intensity to those in the more recent past, but were of longer duration. This suggests that water resource managers may need to consider a wider range of variability than previously indicated by the instrumental record.},

Evidence for senescence diminishes with longevity; only P. sitchensis exhibits a post-maturity decline in tree productivity after accounting for leaf mass. Growth efficiency declines with age in all species, falling most rapidly in P. sitchensis followed by P. menziesii, S. sempervirens, and S. giganteum in the same sequence as longevity. Centuries-long time series of age, size, and growth increments identify years when trees first reach a given height as well as biomass and growth rates at that height, providing snapshots of performance useful for simulating development. Stands dominated by P. sitchensis and P. menziesii gain height at similar rates, but P. sitchensis accumulates biomass more rapidly until senescence curtails tree productivity, which takes centuries longer in P. menziesii. Whereas S. sempervirens in primary forest grows more slowly than P. sitchensis and P. menziesii until \textasciitilde 70~m tall, S. sempervirens in secondary forest outpaces other conifers with biomass increments approaching global maxima within a few centuries. Beyond \textasciitilde 70~m, S. giganteum gains height more slowly than other conifers, but it sustains relatively high biomass increments for millennia. Both within and beyond their native ranges, the four tallest conifers have unrealized potential to provide ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {As the only species exceeding 90 m in height and 2000 years of age, Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum provide the optimal platform upon which to examine interactions among tree structure, age, and growth. We climbed 140 trees in old-growth redwood forests across California, USA, spanning a broad range of sizes and including the tallest, largest, and oldest known living individuals (i.e., 115.86 vs. 96.29 m tall, 424 vs. 582 Mg aboveground dry mass, and 2510 vs. 3240 years old for Sequoia and Sequoiadendron, respectively). We used a combination of direct measurements, hierarchical sampling, and dendrochronology to quantify tree structure and annual growth increments through old age. We also developed equations to predict aboveground attributes of standing redwoods via ground-based measurements. Compared to Sequoia, Sequoiadendron develops thicker bark on lower trunks, provisions leaves with more sapwood, and delays heartwood production throughout the crown. Main trunk wood volume growth (up to 1.6 vs. 0.9 m3/yr), aboveground biomass growth (up to 0.77 vs. 0.45 Mg/yr), and aboveground growth efficiency (0.55 {$\pm$} 0.04 vs. 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.01 kg annual growth per kg leaves, mean {$\pm$} SE) are all higher in Sequoia. Two independent dimensions of structure\textemdash size and aboveground vigor\textemdash are the strongest predictors of tree-level productivity in both species. A third dimension, relative trunk size, is a significant predictor of growth in Sequoia such that trees with relatively large main trunks compared to their crowns produce more wood annually. Similar-size trees grow at similar rates regardless of latitude or elevation in tall forests of each species. Recent annual growth increments are higher than in the past for the majority of trees, and old trees are just as responsive to environmental changes as young trees. Negative growth\textendash age relationships in previous centuries and positive growth\textendash age relationships in recent decades reflect sampling bias and shifting disturbance regimes. Overall, we find little (if any) evidence for negative effects of old age on tree-level productivity in either species. Except for recovery periods following temporary reductions in crown size, annual increments of wood volume and biomass growth increase as redwoods enlarge with age until extrinsic forces cause tree death.},

We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species \textendash{} Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens \textendash{} representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85\% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351m3) than contained in any tree we measured {$<$}1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

Most conifers were entirely resistant, whereas dicot trees were vulnerable. Less embolism in Alaskan dicot trees was associated with fewer freeze\textemdash thaw events in Alaska vs. Utah. Vulnerability was positively correlated with conduit volume and hydraulic conductance per unit xylem area (ks).

Dicot species either reversed winter embolism by refilling vessels with positive root pressures during spring (Betula, Alnus spp.), or tolerated it and relied on new xylem production to restore hydraulic conductance (Quercus sp.).

Here, to better understand the historic hydroclimate within the Wabash River Basin, we reconstructed June\textendash September streamflow for a tributary of the Wabash River using three statistical approaches: the traditional basin approach, and the recently-developed climate-footprint, and drought-reconstruction approaches. Our reconstructions explained 53\textendash 71\% of the variance for the common period (1941\textendash 1984). We find that in our three reconstructions, there are extreme droughts and pluvials that exceed those during the instrumental period, including a sustained five-decade low-flow event in the early 19th century. Overall, we find that the traditional basin approach produced the most robust model but had the shortest reconstruction length of the three approaches, as it requires the predictor chronologies to be derived from within the basin. Our results indicate that there are merits and drawbacks to each approach with the general pattern of sacrificing variance explained for reconstruction length.},

Few differences were observed between the oak species. All vessel chronologies were associated with those of ring dimension and none revealed a unique climate signal. Current growing season conditions were mainly associated with latewood features, whereas those of the year prior to ring formation were mainly associated with earlywood features. The best climate variable to reconstruct was the July Canadian Drought Code and the best reconstruction model was derived from earlywood, latewood, and ring-width chronologies. We conclude that vessel chronologies for Q. alba and Q. rubra have limited use in dendroclimatology. Vessel features are best used to identify event years recorded during the life of a tree. Vessel series could prove useful, however, in calibrating physiologically based models of tree growth.},

However, studies observing growth at sub-daily temporal scales remain scarce. We analysed sub-daily growth dynamics and its climatic drivers recorded by point dendrometers for 35 trees of three temperate broadleaved species during the years 2015\textendash 2020. We isolated irreversible growth driven by cambial activity from the dendrometer records. Next, we compared the intra-annual growth patterns among species and delimited their climatic optima. The growth of all species peaked at air temperatures between 12 and 16\textdegree C and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) below 0.1 kPa. Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica, both diffuse-porous, sustained growth under suboptimal VPD. Ring-porous Quercus robur experienced a steep decline of growth rates with reduced air humidity. This resulted in multiple irregular growth peaks of Q. robur during the year. By contrast, the growth patterns of the diffuse-porous species were always right-skewed unimodal with a peak in June between day of the year 150\textendash 170. Intra-annual growth patterns are shaped more by VPD than temperature. The different sensitivity of radial growth to VPD is responsible for unimodal growth patterns in both diffuse-porous species and multimodal growth pattern in Q. robur.},

We found that L. tulipifera growing in the urban forest responded similarly with small differences to climate compared to the non-urban sites. Radial growth from urban L. tulipifera had statistically similar correlation values with temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation compared to the trees in non-urban forests. Growth variability between the urban and non-urban L. tulipifera trees showed good agreement through time with the exception of the 20th century, where the urban forest experienced a stand-wide release from competition. Our results indicate that some urban forests may function similarly to non-urban forests from an ecological perspective. These findings suggest management practices from non-urban old-growth forest could be useful for management of rare urban old-growth forests.},

In 2012, the contiguous United States experienced exceptionally warm temperatures and the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, resulting in substantial economic damage. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of such events because warmer temperatures and a higher prevalence of drought are projected in a changing climate. Here, we combine an extensive network of direct ecosystem flux measurements with satellite remote sensing and atmospheric inverse modeling to quantify the impact of the warmer spring and summer drought on biosphere-atmosphere carbon and water exchange in 2012. We consistently find that earlier vegetation activity increased spring carbon uptake and compensated for the reduced uptake during the summer drought, which mitigated the impact on net annual carbon uptake. The early phenological development in the Eastern Temperate Forests played a major role for the continental-scale carbon balance in 2012. The warm spring also depleted soil water resources earlier, and thus exacerbated water limitations during summer. Our results show that the detrimental effects of severe summer drought on ecosystem carbon storage can be mitigated by warming-induced increases in spring carbon uptake. However, the results also suggest that the positive carbon cycle effect of warm spring enhances water limitations and can increase summer heating through biosphere\textendash atmosphere feedbacks.},

However, the environmental control of autumn phenology remains significantly understudied in striking contrast to spring phenology. In this study, we used linear mixed effects model with ground-based phenology observations in northeastern USA and found that both weather stressors (e.g. heat- and drought-stress and heavy rainfall) during the growing season and spring phenology significantly affected inter-annual variation in autumn phenology of twelve dominant deciduous tree species. While warm temperatures and drought lead to later fall phenology for most species, heavy rainfall and heat stress lead to earlier leaf coloration and leaf drop. We also found that the phenological sensitivities to weather stressors are diversely species-specific. Under future climate change projections, we predicted that greater summer heat-stress in the future will cause abbreviated leaf coloration seasons for most species. Our mixed-effects modeling framework suggested that accounting for phenological variations among individual trees, species and sites largely improved model predictions, which should not be overlooked in phenological model development. Our study improves our understanding of how species-specific autumnal phenology responds to weather stresses, and describes a new modeling framework to investigate both inter-annual phenological changes and local variations among trees, species, and sites. Our predictions on autumn phenological shifts will help in assessing the effects of climate change on forest community and ecosystem processes in the future.},

Using field data collected from the literature, this study explored the global forest {$\tau$}w and investigated its influence on model simulations of aboveground biomass (AGB) at a global scale. Specifically, {$\tau$}w was found to be related to forest age, annual temperature, and precipitation at a global scale, but its determinants were different among various plant function types. The estimated global forest {$\tau$}w based on the filed data showed large spatial heterogeneity, which plays an important role in model simulation of AGB by a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). The {$\tau$}w could change the resulting AGB in tenfold based on a site-level test using the Monte Carlo method. At the global level, different parameterization schemes of the Integrated Biosphere Simulator using the estimated {$\tau$}w resulted in a twofold change in the AGB simulation for 2100. Our results highlight the influences of various biotic and abiotic variables on forest {$\tau$}w. The estimation of {$\tau$}w in our study may help improve the model simulations and reduce the parameter's uncertainty over the projection of future AGB in the current DGVM or Earth System Models. A clearer understanding of the responses of {$\tau$}w to climate change and the corresponding sophisticated description of forest growth/mortality in model structure is also needed for the improvement of carbon stock prediction in future studies.},

  abstract = {Limits to the growing season                            The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani               et al.               show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake.

Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},

  abstract = {Climate variability influences both plant phenology and physiology, resulting in inter-annual variation in terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, it is still difficult to explain the inter-annual variability of GPP. In this study, we propose a Statistical Model of Integrated Phenology and Physiology (SMIPP) to explain the contributions of maximum daily GPP (GPPmax), and start and end of the growing season (GSstart and GSend) to the inter-annual variability of GPP observed at 27 sites across North America and Europe. Strong relationships are found between the anomalies of GSstart and spring GPP (r=0.82{$\pm$}0.10), GPPmax and summer GPP (r=0.90{$\pm$}0.14), and GSend and autumn GPP (r=0.75{$\pm$}0.18) within each site. Partial correlation analysis further supports strong correlations of annual GPP with GSstart (partial r value being 0.72{$\pm$}0.20), GPPmax (0.87{$\pm$}0.15), and GSend (0.59{$\pm$}0.26), respectively. In addition, the three indicators are found independent from each other to influence annual GPP at most of the 27 sites. Overall, the site-calibrated SMIPP explains 90{$\pm$}11\% of the annual GPP variability among the 27 sites. In general, GPPmax contributes to annual GPP variation more than the two phenological indicators. These results indicate that the inter-annual variability of GPP can be effectively estimated using the three indicators. Investigating plant physiology, and spring and autumn phenology to environmental changes can improve the prediction of the annual GPP trajectory under future climate change.},

  abstract = {Earlier leaf-out and later autumn leaf senescence under climate warming have been linked to increases in plant productivity and ecosystem carbon uptake. Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass remains unclear. Here we use a 3-year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, and one shrub Lonicera xylosteum) under spring and autumn warming. In both tree species, the magnitude\textemdash and in Quercus even the direction\textemdash of the effects of growing-season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf-out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8\%\textendash 2.5\%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2\%\textendash 2.1\%. Advances in leaf-out also led to increased root-to-shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf-out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass. Synthesis. The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing-season length per se is a weak indicator of individual-level tree productivity. The results further imply that phenological shifts are reshaping the functional balance between above- and below-ground growth, which is critical for quantifying forest carbon dynamics under climate change.},

  abstract = {Ongoing global warming is causing phenological shifts that affect photosynthesis and growth rates in temperate woody species. However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warming\textemdash as is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn months\textemdash on autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4~\textdegree C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.},

Compared with traditional `big-leaf' models that simulate forest stands, `next-generation' vegetation models aim to track carbon-, light-, water-, and nutrient-limited growth of individual trees. Wood biology can play an important role in delivering the required knowledge at tissue-to-individual levels, at minute-to-century scales and for model parameterization and benchmarking. We propose a wood biology research agenda that contributes to filling six knowledge gaps: sink versus source limitation, drivers of intra-annual growth, drought impacts, functional wood traits, dynamic biomass allocation, and nutrient cycling. Executing this agenda will expedite model development and increase the ability of models to forecast global change impact on forest dynamics.},

Consequently, the effects of day\textendash night conditions on tree growth remained uncertain. Here we present the first comprehensive field study of hourly-resolved radial stem growth of seven temperate tree species, based on 57 million underlying data points over a period of up to 8 yr. We show that trees grow mainly at night, with a peak after midnight, when the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is among the lowest. A high VPD strictly limits radial stem growth and allows little growth during daylight hours, except in the early morning. Surprisingly, trees also grow in moderately dry soil when the VPD is low. Species-specific differences in diel growth dynamics show that species able to grow earlier during the night are associated with the highest number of hours with growth per year and the largest annual growth increment. We conclude that species with the ability to overcome daily water deficits faster have greater growth potential. Furthermore, we conclude that growth is more sensitive than carbon uptake to dry air, as growth stops before stomata are known to close.},
