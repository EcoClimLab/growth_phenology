  abstract = {We have investigated the spatio-temporal carbon balance patterns resulting from forcing a dynamic global vegetation model with output from 18 climate models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) ensemble. We found robust patterns in terms of an extra-tropical loss of carbon, except for a temperature induced shift in phenology, leading to an increased spring uptake of carbon. There are less robust patterns in the tropics, a result of disagreement in projections of precipitation and temperature. Although the simulations generally agree well in terms of the sign of the carbon balance change in the middle to high latitudes, there are large differences in the magnitude of the loss between simulations. Together with tropical uncertainties these discrepancies accumulate over time, resulting in large differences in total carbon uptake over the coming century (-0.97\textendash 2.27 Pg C yr-1 during 2006\textendash 2100). The terrestrial biosphere becomes a net source of carbon in ten of the 18 simulations adding to the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, while the remaining eight simulations indicate an increased sink of carbon.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring reconstructions of temperature often target trees at altitudinal or latitudinal tree line where annual growth is broadly expected to be limited by and respond to temperature variability. Based on this principal, regions with sparse tree line would seem to be restricted in their potential to reconstruct past temperatures. In the northeastern United States, there are only two published temperature reconstructions. Previous work in the region reconstructing moisture availability, however, has shown that using a greater diversity of species can improve reconstruction model skill. Here, we use a network of 228 tree-ring records composed of 29 species to test the hypothesis that an increase in species diversity among the pool of predictors improves reconstructions of past temperatures. Chamaecyparis thyoides alone explained 31\% of the variability in observed cool-season minimum temperatures, but a multispecies model increased the explained variance to 44\%. Liriodendron tulipifera, a species not previously used for temperature reconstructions, explained a similar amount of variance as Chamaecyparis thyoides (12.9\% and 20.8\%, respectively). Increasing the species diversity of tree proxies has the potential for improving reconstruction of paleotemperatures in regions lacking latitudinal or elevational tree lines provided that long-lived hardwood records can be located.},

  abstract = {Background. Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Methods/Design. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world's forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types \textendash{} tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age {$<$}100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. Review Results/ Synthesis. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. Discussion. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Results from the fully and biogeochemically coupled simulations in which CO2 increases at a rate of 1\,\%\,yr-1 (1pctCO2) from its preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of carbon\textendash concentration and carbon\textendash climate feedback parameters which measure the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate, respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The strength of the carbon\textendash concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes over land (mean\,{$\pm$}\,standard deviation\,=\,0.97\,{$\pm$}\,0.40\,PgC\,ppm-1) and ocean (0.79\,{$\pm$}\,0.07\,PgC\,ppm-1), while the carbon\textendash climate feedback over land (-45.1\,{$\pm$}\,50.6\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (-17.2\,{$\pm$}\,5.0\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is 1.77\,{$\pm$}\,0.37\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1 and is similar to that found in CMIP5 models (1.63\,{$\pm$}\,0.48\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1) but with somewhat reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation are simplified when the small temperature change in the biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon cycle models.},

During the last three decades, the thermal potential growing season has lengthened by about 10.5 days (P {$<$} 0.01, 1982\textendash 2011), which is unprecedented in the context of the past 60 years. The overall lengthening has been stronger and more significant in Eurasia (12.6 days, P {$<$} 0.01) than North America (6.2 days, P {$>$} 0.05). The photosynthetic growing season has closely tracked the pace of warming and extension of the potential growing season in spring, but not in autumn when factors such as light and moisture limitation may constrain photosynthesis. The autumnal extension of the photosynthetic growing season since 1982 appears to be about half that of the thermal potential growing season, yielding a smaller lengthening of the photosynthetic growing season (6.7 days at the circumpolar scale, P {$<$} 0.01). Nevertheless, when integrated over the growing season, photosynthetic activity has closely followed the interannual variations and warming trend in cumulative growing season temperatures. This lengthening and intensification of the photosynthetic growing season, manifested principally over Eurasia rather than North America, is associated with a long-term increase (22.2\% since 1972, P {$<$} 0.01) in the amplitude of the CO2 annual cycle at northern latitudes. The springtime extension of the photosynthetic and potential growing seasons has apparently stimulated earlier and stronger net CO2 uptake by northern ecosystems, while the autumnal extension is associated with an earlier net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. These contrasting responses may be critical in determining the impact of continued warming on northern terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle.},

The plot is in mature secondary mixed deciduous forest 5 km south of Front Royal, Virginia, USA. The initial plot census enumerated 38 932 free-standing living stems and 29 991 living individuals {$\geq$}1 cm dbh comprising 62 species, 38 genera, and 26 families, along with an additional 1248 dead/missing standing stems, for a total of 40 180 stems. Dominant canopy trees include tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), hickories (Carya spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black gum (Nyssa sylvatica). Prominent understory components include spicebush (Lindera benzoin), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis). Few species predominate numerically on the plot; seven species have {$>$}1000 individuals (71.3\% of the total). Mean stand density was 1179 living individuals/ha, while mean basal area was 34.1 m2/ha. Of the total plot area, 4 ha have had white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exclusion since 1990. Woody seedling surveys from 2010\textendash 2012 in 354 1-m2 plots measured 19 415 seedlings of 47 species, from new germinants up to 1 cm dbh. Community-wide seed rain data from 200 0.5-m2 litterfall traps yielded a total of 9197 records from 37 species. Long-term seed data collected from 1986\textendash 2011 for Quercus and Carya within the exclosure and two replicate sites are also presented, documenting considerable annual variation in mast production. Dendrochronological data from 492 tree cores suggested the major canopy trees established circa 1900, but scattered trees of several species existed earlier. Large-scale forest dynamics plots employing standardized methodology have a long, rich history in the tropics. Similar plots in the temperate zone have been largely lacking, however. The SCBI plot represents one of the first of its kind in the Smithsonian Global Earth Observatory's recently established network of such plots, complementing its well-known network of tropical forest plots and enabling comparative studies on forest ecology and climate change at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Using data from 28 flux measurement sites, we performed an analysis of the relationship between annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the length of the carbon uptake period (CUP) (the number of days when the ecosystem is a net carbon sink). The observations suggest a linear correlation between the two quantities. The change in annual carbon exchange per day of the CUP differs significantly between deciduous and evergreen vegetation types. The sites containing vegetation with short-lived foliage (less than 1 year) have higher carbon uptake and respiration rates than evergreen vegetation. The ratio between mean daily carbon exchange rates during carbon uptake and release periods is relatively invariant (2.73{$\pm$}1.08) across different vegetation types. This implies that a balance between carbon release and uptake periods exists despite different photosynthetic pathways, life forms, and leaf habits. The mean daily carbon sequestration rate for these ecosystems never exceeds the carbon emission rate by more than a factor of 3. Growing season lengths for the study sites were derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of advanced very-high-resolution radiometer and from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of VEGETATION SPOT-4. NDVI and EVI were found to be closely related to the CUP, and consequently they also can be used to approximate annual carbon exchange of the ecosystems. This approach has potential for allowing extrapolation of NEE over large areas from remotely sensed data, given a certain amount of ancillary information. This method could complement the currently existing techniques for extrapolation, which rely upon modeling of the individual gross fluxes.},

Based on measurements of ecosystem CO2 flux, radiation absorption by plants, crop yields and a model simulating the terrestrial biosphere, a multinational team of researchers has found that during July and August 2003, 500 million tonnes of carbon escaped from the forests and fields across Europe as a result of extreme heat and drought. The model results and historical data suggest that this dramatic fall in primary productivity is unprecedented during the past century.

  abstract = {In dendroclimatology, tree-ring indices are traditionally calculated as part of the tree-ring chronology development process. This is accomplished by fitting a growth curve to the ring-width series and using it as a series of expectations for more or less well specified null conditions (uniform climate perhaps) of annual radial growth. The ratio of the actual ring widths to these expectations produces a set of dimensionless indices that can be averaged arithmetically with cross-dated indices from other trees into a mean chronology suitable for studies of climatic and environmental change. We show that tree-ring indices calculated in this manner can be systematically biased. The shape of this bias is defined by the reciprocal of the growth curve used to calculate the indices, and its magnitude depends on the proximity of the growth curve to the time axis and its intercept. The underlying cause, however, is lack of fit. To avoid this bias, residuals from the growth curve, rather than ratios, can be computed. If this is done, in conjunction with appropriate transformations to stabilize the variance, the resulting tree-ring chronology will not be biased in the way that ratios can be. This bias problem is demonstrated in an annual tree-ring chronology of bristlecone pine from Campito Mountain, which has been used previously in global change studies. We show that persistent growth increase since AD 1900 in that series is over-estimated by 23.6\% on average when ratios are used instead of residuals, depending on how the ring widths are transformed. Such bias in ratios is not always serious, as it depends on the joint behaviour of the growth curve and data, particularly near the ends of the data interval. Consequently, ratios can still be used safely in many situations. However, to avoid the possibility of ratio bias problems, we recommend that variance-stabilized residuals be used.},

This book, which was published by Academic Press, is sadly out of print and, even though only 12 years old, lim\- ited in its methods and applications. This is owing to the extremely rapid development of the science since the 1970s. Only recently have tree rings as environmental sensors been fully recog\- nized as a valuable tool in detecting environmental change. For example, tree\- ring measurements have been critically important in studies of forest decline in Europe and North America. There are also attempts to use tree-ring analysis for ecological prognosis to solve large-scale regional problems including the sustain\- ability of water supplies, prediction of agricultural crops, and adoption of silvi\- cultural measures in response to ecological changes. More speculatively, dendro\- chronological methods are also used for dating and evaluating some astrophysical phenomena and for indicating possible increase in the biospheric carrying capac\- ity due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  abstract = {Recent climate warming has shifted the timing of spring and autumn vegetation phenological events in the temperate and boreal forest ecosystems of Europe. In many areas spring phenological events start earlier and autumn events switch between earlier and later onset. Consequently, the length of growing season in mid and high latitudes of European forest is extended. However, the lagged effects (i.e. the impact of a warm spring or autumn on the subsequent phenological events) on vegetation phenology and productivity are less explored. In this study, we have (1) characterised extreme warm spring and extreme warm autumn events in Europe during 2003\textendash 2011, and (2) investigated if direct impact on forest phenology and productivity due to a specific warm event translated to a lagged effect in subsequent phenological events. We found that warmer events in spring occurred extensively in high latitude Europe producing a significant earlier onset of greening (OG) in broadleaf deciduous forest (BLDF) and mixed forest (MF). However, this earlier OG did not show any significant lagged effects on autumnal senescence. Needleleaf evergreen forest (NLEF), BLDF and MF showed a significantly delayed end of senescence (EOS) as a result of extreme warm autumn events; and in the following year's spring phenological events, OG started significantly earlier. Extreme warm spring events directly led to significant (p=0.0189) increases in the productivity of BLDF. In order to have a complete understanding of ecosystems response to warm temperature during key phenological events, particularly autumn events, the lagged effect on the next growing season should be considered.},

  abstract = {Temperate and boreal forests undergo drastic functional changes in the springtime, shifting within a few weeks from net carbon (C) sources to net C sinks. Most of these changes are mediated by temperature. The autumn 2006\textendash winter 2007 record warm period was followed by an exceptionally warm spring in Europe, making spring 2007 a good candidate for advances in the onset of the photosynthetically active period. An analysis of a decade of eddy covariance data from six European forests stands, which encompass a wide range of functional types (broadleaf evergreen, broadleaf deciduous, needleleaf evergreen) and a wide latitudinal band (from 44\textdegree{} to 62\textdegree N), revealed exceptional fluxes during spring 2007. Gross primary productivity (GPP) of spring 2007 was the maximum recorded in the decade examined for all sites but a Mediterranean evergreen forest (with a +40 to +130 gC m-2 anomaly compared with the decadal mean over the January\textendash May period). Total ecosystem respiration (TER) was also promoted during spring 2007, though less anomalous than GPP (with a +17 to +93 gC m-2 anomaly over 5 months), leading to higher net uptake than the long-term mean at all sites (+12 to +79 gC m-2 anomaly over 5 months). A correlative analysis relating springtime C fluxes to simple phenological indices suggested spring C uptake and temperatures to be related. The CASTANEA process-based model was used to disentangle the seasonality of climatic drivers (incoming radiation, air and soil temperatures) and biological drivers (canopy dynamics, thermal acclimation of photosynthesis to low temperatures) on spring C fluxes along the latitudinal gradient. A sensitivity analysis of model simulations evidenced the roles of (i) an exceptional early budburst combined with elevated air temperature in deciduous sites, and (ii) an early relief of winter thermal acclimation in coniferous sites for the promotion of 2007 spring assimilation.},

  abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors\textemdash the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)\textemdash are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and {$\psi$}50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

Thus, this is one of the few deciduous forest sites in the world, where a decadal analysis on net ecosystem productivity (NEP) trends is possible. Despite the large interannual variability in NEP, the observations show a significant increase in forest productivity over the past 10 years (by an annual increment of about 10 g C m-2 yr-1). There is evidence that this trend can be explained by longer vegetative seasons, caused by extension of the vegetative activity in the fall. Both phenological and flux observations indicate that the vegetative season extended later in the fall with an increase in length of about 3 days yr-1 for the past 10 years. However, these changes are responsible for only 50\% of the total annual gain in forest productivity in the past decade. A negative trend in air and soil temperature during the winter months may explain an equivalent increase in NEP through a decrease in ecosystem respiration.},

  abstract = {How, where, and why carbon (C) moves into and out of an ecosystem through time are long-standing questions in biogeochemistry. Here, we bring together hundreds of thousands of C-cycle observations at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA, a mid-latitude landscape dominated by 80\textendash 120-yr-old closed-canopy forests. These data answered four questions: (1) where and how much C is presently stored in dominant forest types; (2) what are current rates of C accrual and loss; (3) what biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variability in these rates; and (4) how has climate change affected the forest's C cycle? Harvard Forest is an active C sink resulting from forest regrowth following land abandonment. Soil and tree biomass comprise nearly equal portions of existing C stocks. Net primary production (NPP) averaged 680\textendash 750 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1; belowground NPP contributed 38\textendash 47\% of the total, but with large uncertainty. Mineral soil C measured in the same inventory plots in 1992 and 2013 was too heterogeneous to detect change in soil-C pools; however, radiocarbon data suggest a small but persistent sink of 10\textendash 30 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. Net ecosystem production (NEP) in hardwood stands averaged 300 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. NEP in hemlock-dominated forests averaged 450 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1 until infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid turned these stands into a net C source. Since 2000, NPP has increased by 26\%. For the period 1992\textendash 2015, NEP increased 93\%. The increase in mean annual temperature and growing season length alone accounted for 30\% of the increase in productivity. Interannual variations in GPP and NEP were also correlated with increases in red oak biomass, forest leaf area, and canopy-scale light-use efficiency. Compared to long-term global change experiments at the Harvard Forest, the C sink in regrowing biomass equaled or exceeded C cycle modifications imposed by soil warming, N saturation, and hemlock removal. Results of this synthesis and comparison to simulation models suggest that forests across the region are likely to accrue C for decades to come but may be disrupted if the frequency or severity of biotic and abiotic disturbances increases.},

The historical climate-growth response of trees provides insight into how a species may respond to future changes in climate and also enables us to understand how drought and the timing of drought has impacted growth. In this study, we use dendrochronology to examine the climate and drought response of Quercus myrtifolia Willd. growth on sites from three different scrub ridge systems in central Florida. Five site chronologies and a regional chronology were created from tree-ring measurements. Growth of Q. myrtifolia correlated positively with spring precipitation and the standardized precipitation index (SPI). March, April, May, and June SPI explained 21.5 to 58.3\% of the variance in growth of Q. myrtifolia. The growth response of Q. myrtifolia to spring SPI was similar between sites, with the exception of Malabar West, where Q. myrtifolia occurred on poorly-drained soils. Seasonal droughts explained more of the variation in Q. myrtifolia growth than annual droughts. Spring droughts significantly decreased Q. myrtifolia growth at all sites, and summer droughts significantly reduced growth during the subsequent year at one site. Our data suggest that spring drought is the climatic limiting factor for Q. myrtifolia growth.}

For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\textdegree{} and 1.5\textdegree C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {$\pm$}1\emph{{$\sigma$}}. For the last decade available (2010\textendash 2019), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was 9.6\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.6\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the same decade, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of -0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was only about 0.1\&thinsp;\% with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} when cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.8\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, for total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of 11.5\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (42.2\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;3.3\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also for 2019, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.4\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.5\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} was 3.1\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;1.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} relative to 2019 of about -7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of -6\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\% (-3\&thinsp;\% to -11\&thinsp;\%), and -13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\textendash 2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Qu\'er\'e et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems contribute most of the interannual variability (IAV) in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but processes driving the IAV of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) remain elusive. For a predictive understanding of the global C cycle, it is imperative to identify indicators associated with ecological processes that determine the IAV of NEE. Here, we decompose the annual NEE of global terrestrial ecosystems into their phenological and physiological components, namely maximum carbon uptake (MCU) and release (MCR), the carbon uptake period (CUP), and two parameters, {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}, that describe the ratio between actual versus hypothetical maximum C sink and source, respectively. Using long-term observed NEE from 66 eddy covariance sites and global products derived from FLUXNET observations, we found that the IAV of NEE is determined predominately by MCU at the global scale, which explains 48\% of the IAV of NEE on average while {$\alpha$}, CUP, {$\beta$}, and MCR explain 14\%, 25\%, 2\%, and 8\%, respectively. These patterns differ in water-limited ecosystems versus temperature- and radiation-limited ecosystems; 31\% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of CUP in water-limited ecosystems, and 60\% of the IAV of NEE is determined by the IAV of MCU in temperature- and radiation-limited ecosystems. The Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) model and the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Inter-comparison Project (MsTMIP) models underestimate the contribution of MCU to the IAV of NEE by about 18\% on average, and overestimate the contribution of CUP by about 25\%. This study provides a new perspective on the proximate causes of the IAV of NEE, which suggest that capturing the variability of MCU is critical for modeling the IAV of NEE across most of the global land surface.},

Interannual shifts in photosynthesis were associated with the timing of leaf expansion and senescence. Shifts in annual respiration were associated with anomalies in soil temperature, deep snow in winter, and drought in summer.

In Betula pubescens, B. pendula and Prunus padus vegetative buds were released from dormancy already in December, in Populus tremula in January, whereas in Alnus incana and A. glutinosa dormancy was not released until February. Thermal time (day degrees {$>$}0\textdegree C) to budburst decreased non-linearily with increasing duration of chilling (i. e. duration outdoors), and the slope of this relationship differed among species. The estimated effective base temperature for accumulation of thermal time varied from + 1\textdegree C in P. tremula to -4\textdegree C in P. padus. The use of 0\textdegree C as base temperature is recommended. Long days reduced the thermal time to budburst at all flushing temperatures (9, 15 and 21\textdegree C) in all the above species and in Corylus avellana, whereas Sorbus aucuparia and Rubus idaeus showed no daylength response. Since the chilling requirement of all species was far exceeded even in a winter with January-March temperatures 6.5\textdegree C above normal, it is concluded that under Scandinavian conditions, the main effect of climatic warming would be earlier budburst and, associated with that, a longer growing season and increased risk of spring frost injury.},

For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901\textendash 2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May\textendash July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980\textendash 2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953\textendash 2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.}

Therefore, knowledge of growing seasons over the past decades is essential to predict ecosystem changes. In this study, the long-term changes in the growing seasons of temperate vegetation over the Northern Hemisphere were examined by analyzing satellite-measured normalized difference vegetation index and reanalysis temperature during 1982\textendash 2008. Results showed that the length of the growing season (LOS) increased over the analysis period; however, the role of changes at the start of the growing season (SOS) and at the end of the growing season (EOS) differed depending on the time period. On a hemispheric scale, SOS advanced by 5.2 days in the early period (1982\textendash 1999) but advanced by only 0.2 days in the later period (2000\textendash 2008). EOS was delayed by 4.3 days in the early period, and it was further delayed by another 2.3 days in the later period. The difference between SOS and EOS in the later period was due to less warming during the preseason (January\textendash April) before SOS compared with the magnitude of warming in the preseason (June\textendash September) before EOS. At a regional scale, delayed EOS in later periods was shown. In North America, EOS was delayed by 8.1 days in the early period and delayed by another 1.3 days in the later period. In Europe, the delayed EOS by 8.2 days was more significant than the advanced SOS by 3.2 days in the later period. However, in East Asia, the overall increase in LOS during the early period was weakened in the later period. Admitting regional heterogeneity, changes in hemispheric features suggest that the longer-lasting vegetation growth in recent decades can be attributed to extended leaf senescence in autumn rather than earlier spring leaf-out.},

Standard errors estimated at the grid-box level [SE2 = S2(1 - r)/(1 + (n - 1)r)] depend upon three parameters: the number of site records (n) within each box, the average interrecord correlation (r) between these sites, and the temporal variability (S2) of each grid-box temperature time series. For boxes without data (n = 0), estimates are made using values of S2 interpolated from neighboring grid boxes. Due to spatial correlation, large-scale standard errors in a regional-mean time series are not simply the average of the grid-box standard errors, but depend upon the effective number of independent sites (Neff) over the region. A number of assumptions must be made in estimating the various parameters, and these are tested with observational data and complementary results from multicentury control integrations of three coupled general circulation models (GCMs). The globally complete GCMs enable some assumptions to be tested in a situation where there are no missing data; comparison of parameters computed from the observed and model datasets are also useful for assessing the performance of GCMs. As most of the parameters are timescale dependent, the resulting errors are likewise timescale dependent and must be calculated for each timescale of interest. The length of the observed record enables uncertainties to be estimated on the interannual and interdecadal timescales, with the longer GCM runs providing inferences about longer timescales. For mean annual observed data on the interannual timescale, the 95\% confidence interval for estimates of the global-mean surface temperature since 1951 is 9p 0.12\textdegree C. Prior to 1900, the confidence interval widens to 9p 0.18\textdegree C. Equivalent values on the decadal timescale are smaller: 9p 0.10\textdegree C (1951-95) and 9p 0.16\textdegree C (1851-1900).}

  abstract = {THROUGHOUT the Northern Hemisphere the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide rises in winter and declines in summer, mainly in response to the seasonal growth in land vegetation1\textendash 4. In the far north the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, peak to trough, is between 15 and 20 parts per million by volume5. The annual amplitude diminishes southwards to about 3 p.p.m. near the Equator, owing to the diminishing seasonally of plant activity towards the tropics. In spite of atmospheric mixing processes, enough spatial variability is retained in the seasonal cycle of CO2 to reveal considerable regional detail in seasonal plant activity6. Here we report that the annual amplitude of the seasonal CO2 cycle has increased by 20\%, as measured in Hawaii, and by 40\% in the Arctic, since the early 1960s. These increases are accompanied by phase advances of about 7 days during the declining phase of the cycle, suggesting a lengthening of the growing season. In addition, the annual amplitudes show maxima which appear to reflect a sensitivity to global warming episodes that peaked in 1981 and 1990. We propose that the amplitude increases reflect increasing assimilation of CO2 by land plants in response to climate changes accompanying recent rapid increases in temperature.},

  abstract = {Autumn senescence regulates multiple aspects of ecosystem function, along with associated feedbacks to the climate system. Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

  abstract = {In deciduous forests, spring leaf phenology controls the onset of numerous ecosystem functions. While most studies have focused on a single annual spring event, such as budburst, ecosystem functions like photosynthesis and transpiration increase gradually after budburst, as leaves grow to their mature size. Here, we examine the ``velocity of green-up,'' or duration between budburst and leaf maturity, in deciduous forest ecosystems of eastern North America. We use a diverse data set that includes 301 site-years of phenocam data across a range of sites, as well as 22 years of direct ground observations of individual trees and 3 years of fine-scale high-frequency aerial photography, both from Harvard Forest. We find a significant association between later start of spring and faster green-up: - 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.04 (slope {$\pm$} 1 SE) days change in length of green-up for every day later start of spring within phenocam sites, - 0.31 {$\pm$} 0.06 days/day for trees under direct observation, and - 1.61 {$\pm$} 0.08 days/day spatially across fine-scale landscape units. To explore the climatic drivers of spring leaf development, we fit degree-day models to the observational data from Harvard Forest. We find that the default phenology parameters of the ecosystem model PnET make biased predictions of leaf initiation (39 days early) and maturity (13 days late) for red oak, while the optimized model has biases of 1 day or less. Springtime productivity predictions using optimized parameters are closer to results driven by observational data (within 1\%) than those of the default parameterization (17\% difference). Our study advances empirical understanding of the link between early and late spring phenophases and demonstrates that accurately modeling these transitions is important for simulating seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity.},

  abstract = {In the 45 years after legislation of the Clean Air Act, there has been tremendous progress in reducing acidic air pollutants in the eastern United States, yet limited evidence exists that cleaner air has improved forest health. Here, we investigate the influence of recent environmental changes on the growth and physiology of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees, a key indicator species of forest health, spanning three locations along a 100 km transect in the Central Appalachian Mountains. We incorporated a multiproxy approach using 75-year tree ring chronologies of basal tree growth, carbon isotope discrimination ({$\increment$}13C, a proxy for leaf gas exchange), and {$\delta$}15N (a proxy for ecosystem N status) to examine tree and ecosystem level responses to environmental change. Results reveal the two most important factors driving increased tree growth since ca. 1989 are reductions in acidic sulfur pollution and increases in atmospheric CO2, while reductions in pollutant emissions of NOx and warmer springs played smaller, but significant roles. Tree ring {$\increment$}13C signatures increased significantly since 1989, concurrently with significant declines in tree ring {$\delta$}15N signatures. These isotope chronologies provide strong evidence that simultaneous changes in C and N cycling, including greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of trees and increases in ecosystem N retention, were related to recent increases in red spruce tree growth and are consequential to ecosystem recovery from acidic pollution. Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of the red spruce trees increased by 51\% across the 75-year chronology, and was driven by changes in atmospheric CO2 and acid pollution, but iWUE was not linked to recent increases in tree growth. This study documents the complex environmental interactions that have contributed to the recovery of red spruce forest ecosystems from pervasive acidic air pollution beginning in 1989, about 15 years after acidic pollutants started to decline in the United States.},

  abstract = {As climate change drives increased drought in many forested regions, mechanistic understanding of the factors conferring drought tolerance in trees is increasingly important. The dendrochronological record provides a window through which we can understand how tree size and traits shape growth responses to droughts. We analyzed tree-ring records for 12 species in a broadleaf deciduous forest in Virginia (USA) to test hypotheses for how tree height, microenvironment characteristics, and species' traits shaped drought responses across the three strongest regional droughts over a 60-yr period. Drought tolerance (resistance, recovery, and resilience) decreased with tree height, which was strongly correlated with exposure to higher solar radiation and evaporative demand. The potentially greater rooting volume of larger trees did not confer a resistance advantage, but marginally increased recovery and resilience, in sites with low topographic wetness index. Drought tolerance was greater among species whose leaves lost turgor (wilted) at more negative water potentials and experienced less shrinkage upon desiccation. The tree-ring record reveals that tree height and leaf drought tolerance traits influenced growth responses during and after significant droughts in the meteorological record. As climate change-induced droughts intensify, tall trees with drought-sensitive leaves will be most vulnerable to immediate and longer-term growth reductions.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees' grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a finer understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions finer than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workflow to help forest ecologists fit growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal fits. We offer R code to implement this workflow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to fitting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we fit the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-specific patterns, and phenology.},

  abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971\textendash 2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade-1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days\textdegree C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day\textdegree C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P{$<$}0.001).},

Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a `systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates `very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

  abstract = {Wood products are considered to contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. A critical gap in the life cycle of wood products is to transfer the raw timber from the forest to the processing wood industry and, thus, the primary wood products. Therefore, often rough estimates are used for this step to obtain total forestry carbon balances. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the fate of timber harvested in Thuringian state forests (central Germany), representing a large, intensively managed forested region, and (2) to quantify carbon stocks and the lifetime of primary wood products made from this timber. The analyses were based on the amount and assortments of actually sold timber, and production parameters of the companies that bought and processed this timber. In addition, for coniferous stands of a selected Thuringian forest district, we calculated potential effects of management, as expressed by different thinning regimes on wood products and their lifetimes. Total annual timber sale of soft- and hardwoods from Thuringian state forests (195,000~ha) increased from about 136,893~t~C (\textasciitilde 0.7~t~C~ha-1~year-1) in 1996 to 280,194~t~C (\textasciitilde 1.4~t~C~ha-1~year-1) in 2005. About 47\% of annual total timber harvest went into short-lived wood products with a mean residence time (MRT)~{$<~$}25 years. Thirty-one per cent of the total harvest went into wood products with an MRT of 25\textendash 43~years, and only 22\% was used as construction wood and glued wood, products with the longest MRT (50 years). The average MRT of carbon in harvested wood products was 20~years. Thinning from above throughout the rotation of spruce forests would lead to an average MRT in harvested wood products of about 23~years, thinning from below of about 18 years. A comparison of our calculations with estimates that resulted from the products module of the CO2FIX model (Nabuurs et al. 2001) demonstrates the influence of regional differences in forest management and wood processing industry on the lifetime of harvested wood products. To our knowledge, the present study provides for the first time real carbon inputs of a defined forest management unit to the wood product sector by linking data on raw timber production, timber sales and wood processing. With this new approach and using this data, it should be possible to substantially improve the net-carbon balance of the entire forestry sector.},

  abstract = {Nonstructural carbohydrate reserves support tree metabolism and growth when current photosynthates are insufficient, offering resilience in times of stress. We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch and sugars) concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated the mean age of the starch and sugars in a subset of trees using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike. With these data, we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes in a process-based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season, lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon-based estimates indicated that the mean age of the starch and sugars in red maple (Acer rubrum) was 7\textendash 14 yr. A two-pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool, and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment, compared with zero- or one-pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {A key component in describing forest carbon (C) dynamics is the change in downed dead wood biomass through time. Specifically, there is a dearth of information regarding the residence time of downed woody debris (DWD), which may be reflected in the diversity of wood (for example, species, size, and stage of decay) and site attributes (for example, climate) across the study region of eastern US forests. The empirical assessment of DWD rate of decay and residence time is complicated by the decay process itself, as decomposing logs undergo not only a reduction in wood density over time but also reductions in biomass, shape, and size. Using DWD repeated measurements coupled with models to estimate durations in various stages of decay, estimates of DWD half-life (THALF), residence time (TRES), and decay rate (k constants) were developed for 36 tree species common to eastern US forests. Results indicate that estimates for THALF averaged 18 and 10 years for conifers and hardwoods, respectively. Species that exhibited shorter THALF tended to display a shorter TRES and larger k constants. Averages of TRES ranged from 57 to 124 years for conifers and from 46 to 71 years for hardwoods, depending on the species and methodology for estimating DWD decomposition considered. Decay rate constants (k) increased with increasing temperature of climate zones and ranged from 0.024 to 0.040 for conifers and from 0.043 to 0.064 for hardwoods. These estimates could be incorporated into dynamic global vegetation models to elucidate the role of DWD in forest C dynamics.},

Intraspecific (Populus tremuloides) and intrageneric (Betula, Alnus) comparisons were made between sites in northern Utah and interior Alaska.

Between sites, Alaskan dicot trees embolized less than their Utah counterparts. Differences were explained by vulnerability to embolism caused by freeze\textemdash thaw cycles. Most conifers were entirely resistant, whereas dicot trees were vulnerable. Less embolism in Alaskan dicot trees was associated with fewer freeze\textemdash thaw events in Alaska vs. Utah. Vulnerability was positively correlated with conduit volume and hydraulic conductance per unit xylem area (ks). Tracheids were superior to vessels in avoiding freeze\textemdash thaw\textemdash induced embolism, and had lower ks. At the other extreme, ring\textemdash porous xylem had the highest ks but lost {$>$}90\% of hydraulic conductance after a single freeze\textemdash thaw event. Vulnerability to water\textemdash stress\textemdash induced cavitation was not correlated with conduit volume or ks. Dicot species either reversed winter embolism by refilling vessels with positive root pressures during spring (Betula, Alnus spp.), or tolerated it and relied on new xylem production to restore hydraulic conductance (Quercus sp.). Conifers reversed embolism by refilling tracheids in the absence of positive pressure. Populus species behaved inconsistently, showing some reversal one year but none the next. Even without embolism reversal, Populus species had hydraulic conductances per unit leaf area equal to other diffuse\textemdash porous species.},

  abstract = {The global terrestrial carbon sink offsets one-third of the world's fossil fuel emissions, but the strength of this sink is highly sensitive to large-scale extreme events. In 2012, the contiguous United States experienced exceptionally warm temperatures and the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, resulting in substantial economic damage. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of such events because warmer temperatures and a higher prevalence of drought are projected in a changing climate. Here, we combine an extensive network of direct ecosystem flux measurements with satellite remote sensing and atmospheric inverse modeling to quantify the impact of the warmer spring and summer drought on biosphere-atmosphere carbon and water exchange in 2012. We consistently find that earlier vegetation activity increased spring carbon uptake and compensated for the reduced uptake during the summer drought, which mitigated the impact on net annual carbon uptake. The early phenological development in the Eastern Temperate Forests played a major role for the continental-scale carbon balance in 2012. The warm spring also depleted soil water resources earlier, and thus exacerbated water limitations during summer. Our results show that the detrimental effects of severe summer drought on ecosystem carbon storage can be mitigated by warming-induced increases in spring carbon uptake. However, the results also suggest that the positive carbon cycle effect of warm spring enhances water limitations and can increase summer heating through biosphere\textendash atmosphere feedbacks.},

Using field data collected from the literature, this study explored the global forest {$\tau$}w and investigated its influence on model simulations of aboveground biomass (AGB) at a global scale. Specifically, {$\tau$}w was found to be related to forest age, annual temperature, and precipitation at a global scale, but its determinants were different among various plant function types. The estimated global forest {$\tau$}w based on the filed data showed large spatial heterogeneity, which plays an important role in model simulation of AGB by a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). The {$\tau$}w could change the resulting AGB in tenfold based on a site-level test using the Monte Carlo method. At the global level, different parameterization schemes of the Integrated Biosphere Simulator using the estimated {$\tau$}w resulted in a twofold change in the AGB simulation for 2100. Our results highlight the influences of various biotic and abiotic variables on forest {$\tau$}w. The estimation of {$\tau$}w in our study may help improve the model simulations and reduce the parameter's uncertainty over the projection of future AGB in the current DGVM or Earth System Models. A clearer understanding of the responses of {$\tau$}w to climate change and the corresponding sophisticated description of forest growth/mortality in model structure is also needed for the improvement of carbon stock prediction in future studies.},

  abstract = {Climate variability influences both plant phenology and physiology, resulting in inter-annual variation in terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, it is still difficult to explain the inter-annual variability of GPP. In this study, we propose a Statistical Model of Integrated Phenology and Physiology (SMIPP) to explain the contributions of maximum daily GPP (GPPmax), and start and end of the growing season (GSstart and GSend) to the inter-annual variability of GPP observed at 27 sites across North America and Europe. Strong relationships are found between the anomalies of GSstart and spring GPP (r=0.82{$\pm$}0.10), GPPmax and summer GPP (r=0.90{$\pm$}0.14), and GSend and autumn GPP (r=0.75{$\pm$}0.18) within each site. Partial correlation analysis further supports strong correlations of annual GPP with GSstart (partial r value being 0.72{$\pm$}0.20), GPPmax (0.87{$\pm$}0.15), and GSend (0.59{$\pm$}0.26), respectively. In addition, the three indicators are found independent from each other to influence annual GPP at most of the 27 sites. Overall, the site-calibrated SMIPP explains 90{$\pm$}11\% of the annual GPP variability among the 27 sites. In general, GPPmax contributes to annual GPP variation more than the two phenological indicators. These results indicate that the inter-annual variability of GPP can be effectively estimated using the three indicators. Investigating plant physiology, and spring and autumn phenology to environmental changes can improve the prediction of the annual GPP trajectory under future climate change.},

  abstract = {Ongoing global warming is causing phenological shifts that affect photosynthesis and growth rates in temperate woody species. However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warming\textemdash as is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn months\textemdash on autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4~\textdegree C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.},
