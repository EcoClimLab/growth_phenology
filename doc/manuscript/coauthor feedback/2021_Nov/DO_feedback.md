from Dave Orwig:

overall thoughts:  a very nice melding of dendrobands and tree ring chronologies.   it highlights how little we know about wood phenology and also shines light on disconnects with flux tower results and tree-ring results.  you mention several times that extended growing seasons can lead to higher NEE and likely due to earlier springs;  I was wondering if it might be worth mentioning that late falls extend the growing season but since most wood growth ends by mid to late summer this is basically inconsequential to annual growth of trees (but not flux towers..)   this was inferred in the paper, but just curious if worth mentioning.
 
I am left wondering if warm spring temps do matter in years with higher moisture?   overall warm springs did not matter to annual ring width, but maybe it does if it also coincides with years with high rainfall?  curious if worth mentioning at least that it needs to be examined instead of the thought that warm springs will be a negative effect with warm temps.
 
Dendroband analysis , last sentence of first paragraph “the” needed before ecosystem?
 
Methods first sentence suggest adding” data or measurements” after dendrometer band.
              Tree-ring analysis first sentence  suggest adding “locations or sites” after 108?
love extended data figures!!   extended data table 1 has errors in diffuse and ring-porous species as they seem mixed as presented.
