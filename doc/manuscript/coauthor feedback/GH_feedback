from Grant Harley:

Please find attached the draft with a couple comments in there. I first started to edit for wordsmithing/details, then realized we’re not quite at that stage. I also didn’t want to add a bunch of unnecessary comments on top of all the ones that are already on this doc, so I summarize below.
 

—Yeah, little bit of overlap between fig 2C,D and fig 3, but I think fig 3 stands alone as it makes the phenology-temp relationship easier to interpret.
—I’m in favor of keeping fig 3, but with a few suggested changes. Most of what I’m about to type has already been stated in a comment, but hey, it makes me feel like I’m contributing 😉
 
Fig 3:
—Q: would it make more sense to align panels by wood type than by site, e.g. ring-porous next to each other, then diffuse-porous?
—could probably get away without consistent x axes (simply bc adding consistent x axes would make the fig uninterpretable), but consistent y-axes might be possible.
—I like the idea of plotting the DOY variables (currently plotted as filled circles) as open circles, maybe playing with the transparency, but definitely playing with the plotting level…e.g. plot blues and reds in the background but render the green and purple in the foreground so they can be seen.
–Ooff, I’m not sure I can picture in my mind a way to combine these 4 panels into 2 as suggested.
—Bottomline, I think Fig 3 represents one of the major findings of the paper, and certainly deserves to be 1 of the “Big 4” figs.
 
Fig 4
—I’m sure the last question you want right now is: “do you want more data?” As I was reading it, though, I remembered that I have a white ash tree-ring chronology that I developed from the Harvard Forest when I was there in 2009. Never published on it, but it spans the period 1909 to 2008. Below is a quick-and-dirty climate response I did for a presentation to HF. I know it’s only 1 record, but I noticed there’s only 1 ring-porous crn from HF, let me know if you’d like to include the white ash from HF and I’ll send along!
