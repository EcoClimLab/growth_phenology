# Results

Files here are results from analyses which are obtained by running the R scripts. Most are used to create the figures and tables in the manuscript. 

## Tree cores
This folder contains the results from the tree core drought analysis (results/tree_cores/processed_data; from https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/tree_core_drought_interaction.R and https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/tree_core_drought_no_interactions.R) and results used to create the quiltplot figures (results/tree_cores/quiltplots; https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/doc/manuscript/tables_figures/tmax_quiltplot.pdf) 

## Bayesian outputs
The outputs from the bayesian dendroband analysis (https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/Pheno_tsensitivity_figure_april_april_tmax.R and https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/Pheno_tsensitivity_figure_tmax.R)

## Climwin results 
Results from the climwin analysis (https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/HF_Climwin_Cameron.R and https://github.com/EcoClimLab/growth_phenology/blob/master/RScripts/SCBI_Climwin_Cameron.R) used to find the critical temperature windows for each wood type/site combination
